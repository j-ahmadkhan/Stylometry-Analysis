Until recently, thedecision on which toilet to purchase was based primarily on style,and with good reason. Toilets not only looked pretty much alike, butthey all worked with the same functionality and quality, and themechanical design had not changed much since the 1800's.That isstill true of the basic builder-grade models, but technology hasbrought about vast improvements in the design of upgradeunits. According to a recent Water Conservation Study, the average personflushes the toilet 5 times a day. Those 5 flushes per person maynot seem like much until you realize that each person flushing anolder 3.5 - 7 gallons per flush (gpf) toilet, uses 6,400-12,800gallons/year. As a water-conservation measure, the U.S. NationalEnergy Policy Act of 1992 eliminated the standard 3.5 gallon flushand mandated a new standard of 1.6 gallons per flush (gpf)/6 litersper flush (lpf) maximum in all new toilets. Since 1994, all toilets sold in the U.S. use 1.6gallons per flush, or less. Replacing old toilets with newer modelsin your home will save up to $50 to $125 and up to 10,500 gallonseach year, depending on utility rates and usage habits.Consumerscomplained that with less water, toilets often clogged or failed toempty completely, forcing manufacturers to redesign toilets withlarger trap ways, better water flow designs, and even withpressure-assists. Standard Efficiency Toilets -maximum of 1.6gpf/6.0-lpf Using the new 1.6 gpf toilet, the same 5 flushes use 2,900 gallonsper person, But even with this reduction in water usage,standard-efficiency toilets are responsible for roughly 26% of allwater used indoors. High-Efficiency Toilets (HETs)- maximum of 1.3gpf/4.8-lpf The new high-efficiency toilets use 1.28 gpf (or less) - an averageof at least 20% less water than a standard 1.6 gpf toilet. Thattranslates into a total usage of 2,300 gallons/year per person.Although they use much less water, these toilets are veryefficient. Some new Pressure-Assist single-flush toilets use1.1-gpf/4.0-lpf and below. Note for High-Efficiency Toilets: * Source: California Urban Water Conservation Council All toilets, regardless of flush volume, may experience problemswhen installed in locations with degraded or damaged drain linesystems, e.g., root intrusion, sagging or broken lines, buildup ofsolids, etc., or in commercial buildings with very long drain lineruns and no additional sources of waste water near the toiletfixture. However, when installed where these conditions exist, HETs, becauseof their reduced flush volume, could be slightly more susceptibleto problems. Dual Flush Toilets - (0.8 -1.1gpf / 1.6gpf - 3.0-4.0-lpf/6.0-lpf) The newest of the high-efficient toilets are dual-flush, whichallow you to select the amount of water that is used to flush thetoilet. A "short flush" (0.8 to 1.1-gpf/3.0 to 4.0-lpf) is used toflush liquid wastes, and a "full flush" (1.6-gpf/6.0-lpf ) is usedfor solid wastes. THINGS TO CONSIDER IN CHOOSING YOURTOILET A toilet is a plumbing fixture that collectshuman waste and removes it through pipes into a sewer system orseptic tank.A typical toilet consists of a bowl and tank, both ofwhich are filled with water. The bowl serves as a receptacle forwaste, and the tank holds the water used to flush the waste out ofthe bowl.In addition, the water in the bowl helps to keep sewergases from entering the house through the trap. Toilets are available in a variety of styles and colors, andin a wide price range. Most homeowners will install basic units inguest baths and in children's bathrooms, but will upgrade for thepowder room that will be used by company, and will go all out fortheir master bath. Be aware, not all options or features areavailable in all types of toilets. Your choices may be limited bythe type of flush system your toilet uses. Newer technologies,because they are newer, offer a more limited range of styles,colors and options. Gravity type toilets offer the most flexibilityin style. Water Pressure: Toiletslike all plumbing fixtures and fixture fittings, require watersupplied in sufficient volume and at pressures adequate to enablethem to function properly. Most codes establish the minimum size of the watersupply system and require a minimum of 15- to 20-psi flowingpressure at the toilet water supply inlet. NOTE: In areas where the water pressure is low, it may be necessary toincrease water supply sizes and/or incorporate a pressure boostersystem. Be sure to consult with a plumbing contractor to determineif the toilet you select will operate properly with the availablepressure. The shapeof the toilet bowl : The main choiceshere are an elongated bowl and a round front bowl. The round fronttends to be two inches shorter, and works well for smaller spaces.The larger elongated front is more comfortable and sanitary, sincethere is less drip on the toilet. The toilet size: Thereare lots of choices, with different lengths, widths and heights.Make sure you measure the space available for the toilet to ensurea comfortable fit. You also need to consider the rough-in space,which is how far the centerof the toilet bowl is from the finishedwall, since this limits the size of the toilet. The standard distance from the finished wall tothe center line (point where the bowl connects to the floor) formost toilets is 12 inches. However, depending on your plans, thisdistance may vary from 10 to 14 inches. You should know thisdimension before you shop. Most home centers carry toilets with12-inch rough in; if you need something else you'll have tospecify. In gravity fed toilets,the weight of the water from the tank pushes the waste through an Sshaped trap way, as the siphon that is created empties thebowl. With pressure assisted toilets, air in the tankis compressed as it fills with water. When flushing, thepressurized air pushes the water more strongly into the bowl,resulting in a better flush. Disadvantages, though, include greaternoise, expense and difficulty of repairing. One or two piecetoilets: Two piece toilets are more common and inexpensivelypriced, and have a separate tank and bowl which are connected whenthe toilet is installed. One piece toilets have 5 or six parts thatare seamlessly connected into one piece. They tend to more stylish,more expensive, easier to clean, and smaller, making them ideal forsmaller spaces. Maintenance features: Some toilets have features designed to make it easier to take careof them. For instance, Toto, an innovative Japanese manufacturer,has SanaGloss, a ceramic glaze which prevents bacteria and moldbuildup, making the toilet easy to clean. American Standard has itsEasyClean feature. Kohler has an insulated liner for some of itstoilet lines, preventing moisture build-up on the outside of thetank due to condensation. Appearance: while atoilet needs to work well, it also needs to look good in yourbathroom. Fortunately, today toilets come in a huge selection ofcolors and sizes. ROUND or Elongated Toilets come in round-front and elongated sizes, with manydifferent shapes and styles to choose from. Round-front toilets are 2" shorter than elongated models, and arepopular where space is at a premium or where a more traditionallook is preferred. Elongated toilets are the best choice for most homes. The extraspace in the front makes it easier for males to use. The style youselect is a matter of personal taste, and you can choose from avariety of styles, ranging from contemporary totraditional. WALL MOUNT Wall-mount toilets are fastened to the wall, do not have a pedestalor tank, and can be set at almost any height. Since the toiletitself is mounted to the wall, rather the floor, bathroom cleanup abreeze. While they can be used in almost any type of decor, theyare most often used in a contemporary or Euro-stylesetting. Most residential tank less toilets areactually stylish wall-mount toilets with the tank hidden within thewall itself. These units provide a sleek, clean look withoutresorting to smaller fixtures or sacrificing design options.Sincethe toilet tank (cistern) is built into the wall, an additional 6"to 9" of floor space can be gained (depending on the bowl shapedselected). The flush actuator is generally mounted abovethe bowl but some manufacturers, such as Geberit, offer a remoteunit that can be placed on the wall within 6' of thetank. FLOOR MOUNT Standard toilets mount to the floor and have a short pedestal basebelow the bowl. They adapt well to almost any type ofdecor. There are lots of choices in floor mounttoilets: round or elongated bowl, one or two piece, and what heightthe toilet should be. Beyond that you will have a choice of colorsand ornamental trim, and several style options. Always sit down ona toilet before buying it to make sure the height and size arecomfortable. HEIGHT Toilets come in a variety of heights from 10" to 18" (measured fromthe bottom to the top of the rim, not including theseat). The standard toilet is 14 1/2" - 15" high,which most people find too low to be comfortable. In order to meetthe standards of the Americans With Disabilities Act, toiletsshould have a height of either 16 1/2 inches (used in residentialconstruction) or 18 inches (used in commercialconstruction). The 16.5" height is becoming increasingly popularfor use in the Master Bath, but should definitely be considered astandard for use in the Guest Powder Room. These higher toilets areavailable in most models on the market, including one-piecetoilets. Toilet manufacturers are marketing the higher toilets under avariety of names. Kohler's Comfort Height.â„¢(shown left)is oneexample. TYPES OFAVAILABLE TOILETS: Flush mechanisms currently on the market now: Gravity Flush Tank Toilets that have a water tank that works on the gravity principle.Water is released into the bowl and out through the S-shaped trapway, where a siphoning action pulls the waste out of the bowl. Gravity Flush toilets are the most popular. Improved design hasresulted in many good-performing models. Washdown Toilets Have large trap ways and small water spots. A large trap way meansthey are less likely to clog, but a small water spot means theysometimes do not clean the bowl as well as other toilets. Vacuum-Assist Similar to gravity flush. Two plastic tanks within the toilet tankthat hold only 1.6 gal. of water between them, and they areconfigured in such a way that when the toilet is flushed, a vacuumis created that powers the water into the bowl to produce a moreefficient flush. Pressure-Assist Uses compressed air within the tank to propel water to the rim andsiphon jet creating a powerful "push-through" flush. They tend tobe louder and more expensive than gravity toilets, but have areputation for good performance. Electrohydraulic Electrohydraulic toilets are the latest in hi-tech. Using electricmotor(s), pumps(s), and controllers to assist the flushing actionby monitoring and controlling the flush and dictating the exactdischarge from the tank into the bowl. Dual Flush Dual-flush toilets have two buttons, one for solid waste, and onethat flushes at less than 1.6 gpf for liquid waste. Some dual-flushtoilets are wash-down models. Flushometer Valve Typically found in public restrooms. An external valve is connecteddirectly to the pressurized water supply line. The valve isdesigned so that when the toilet is flushed, the water supply isopened to create a pressurized discharge of water into thetoilet.
