The Best Used Car Parts Let's face it, not everybody can afford the prices of new auto spares or pirate parts, especially when the cars are a little older, or even getting rare. Besides, sometimes second-hand is as good as new, and recycling is something every responsible American needs to get their mind around while we still have a planet to call our own. In this article I describe the used car parts industry, how its regulated and what to look out for generally. Read it through whether you're a newbie or a pro. There's always something new under the sun, and you'll be sure to learn something new about recycling automobiles here too.

The biggest problem was of course finding decent spare parts.Thankfully I found New Zealand's leading sports car spare parts company, distributing new and second hand spare parts through out Australasia under the brand "T he MG Car Company of New Zealand Ltd". And they had no difficulty shipping to America either. I had a choice of parts sourced in different forms from a wide range of sources. These included: Original Manufacturer's Equipment (OME) which I always make my first port of call.

Although "T he MG Car Company of New Zealand Ltd" holds stocks of some unique parts, they also recommended I try MG re-conditioners and service agents too. Morris/Austin/BMC vehicle parts plus equipment suppliers. Parts from other models of Morris vehicles plus suppliers such as Lucas electrical, SU fuel pumps etc are good sources of alternative parts. For example for some of the T series parts from Morris 10 /12's are suitable replacements. I can advise you on suitability if you care to drop me off an email. In terms of independently manufactured parts "T he MG Car Company of New Zealand Ltd" has contracts with a number of suppliers (such as manufacturer's brake linings, cylinder head gasket kits, and transmission kits). They even have a few genuine tires left over that will not be obtainable again soon.

Re-engineered and/or rebuilt MG parts Along the way I learned how skilled MG engine re-builders at "T he MG Car Company of New Zealand Ltd" can create engines with high performance components such as pistons, cams and valves. Second-hand parts have always been highly sought after at "T he MG Car Company of New Zealand Ltd" worldwide. They can be your only starting point, but may still require extensive repair and modification. However many will be in a worn or damaged state and will require inspection by an experienced MG engineer first. Wreckers' yards, parts swap meetings and dealers are all good sources too.

Build a Quantum Car from Used Spare Parts Let's Talk Insurance First Although there is a crowd of brokers out there that specialize in arranging insurance for 15-plus year-old sports cars, motorbikes, kit cars, scratch-built specialist vehicles and classic cars, to date there's still no formal insurance grouping for a home-made Quantum, and your usual broker may not even know the name. Be fore-armed with the knowledge that American car insurance premiums are part of a particularly competitive market. If your brain warns you that there's something wrong, strike out and get another quote! Mechanical Knowledge and Tools Quantums are designed with the home builder in mind, so only a very basic toolkit is assumed when building one. Common sense is also more important than previous knowledge.

For instance, many fixing locations are scribe-marked into the mold and all holes over ten millimeters in diameter are are drilled. This ensures a measure of standardization - although of course if you're creative you could also ignore the tiny location markers that indicate the correct position of the wheels, engine and so on. Putting Your Quantum on the Road Pop by your local Vehicle Registration Office after completing two forms relating to the source of parts for the car (i.e. the chassis/shell from Quantum and the rest from scrapyards that hopefully provided receipts and details of the cars they came from at the time).

You'll also need a successful Single Vehicle Approval Examination Report. They'll provide you with that critical first tax disc for your Quantum once that's all done and dusted. After that, you just need to fit plates before you drive your Quantum away and start enjoying the envious looks that other Quantum owners already enjoy.

FAQ's Q: How do I know the parts I order will be compatible with my Quantum? A: All mechanical parts are sourced from a single-model car around which the specification of your Quantum is based . This means the Quantum is not a hybrid car at all - so you can re-order parts using the identity of what you purchased. Anything we don't stock can usually be arranged for next day delivery, just in case our parts department doesn't include it in its huge stock of parts that range from entire engines to minor fixings. Q: I want to build from as wide a range of clean used parts as possible.

A: We supply a choice of both new and second hand components to complete any Quantum. Q: What is Single Vehicle Approval? A: Cars of very low volume are approved via the Single Vehicle Approval (SVA) scheme. Production cars are Ministry 'Type Approved' which involves crash testing and so on. Since crash testing is obviously not feasible when the amateur 'manufacturer' builds only one car, each builder takes their completed car individually to one of the designated HGV testing stations.

There the car is stringently inspected to check features such as Brake ratios Interior design safety External design. There's no need to be nervous about this. The inspector i s just looking at different aspects, which are virtually all related to the design of the vehicle. In reality it's is no more onerous than an annual roadworthy check. Q: Will my local garage service or repair an unusually specialised car like a Quantum?

A: A look under the bonnet, plus a brief explanation from yourself will quickly give your mechanic his bearings, even t hough your local garage may not have seen a Quantum before. Q: How can I convert standard gelcoat bodywork to a finish like the demonstrators at the factory produce? A: Whether factory-built cars, or home build kits, all fibreglass panels are fully machine polished to showroom standards before leaving the factory. In fact the inside surfaces of Quantum molds are polished to such a mirror finish that you can just spray over the product. Q: Where Can I Get More Advice? A: Visit the Quantum Owners Club's website at www.quantumowners.com where you'll be sure to receive a friendly welcome.

A Superb Example: The JC Whitney Story Or how a 1915 scrap metal yard grew to be the largest direct marketer of "everything automotive" in the world. Early Beginnings The place is Chicago. The date is 1915. A Lithuanian immigrant named Israel Warshawsky decides to jump onto the running board of the emerging automotive industry. Henry Ford's Model T has been in mass production for only seven years, yet the cars are already beginning to break down. This is Israel's opportunity. He decides to scavenge auto spares from derelict automobiles. He buys a piece of property on State Street and Archer Avenue in the City's South Side.

The Warshawsky Company just entered the market and opened a scrap metal yard. Business is good. America's entry into World War One ratchets up the salvage business as motor factories turn to tanks instead. Soon, Israel begins buying up failed auto-manufacturer's stocks, and adding their new parts to his second-hand inventory. He has to, because demand for used auto parts has outstripped the supply of derelict cars. After that, he opens a retail store too.

Continuous Growth T hroughout the Great Depression the Warshawsky Company continues to expand. That's because few people could afford new cars or even new spare parts. The company had a larger store and a successful wholesale catalog distributed exclusively by mechanics and Chicago-area gas stations from 1934. Then Israel's son, Roy Warshawsky becomes the new employee with the brightest new ideas. After he joined his father on graduation from Chicago University, Roy recommends a consumer catalog to make products available nationwide.

Dad says "I'll try it". Roy places a sixty-dollar in Popular Mechanics (that was still money then) and invites readers to send in twenty-five cents for a "giant auto parts catalog." There's an instantaneous flood of responses. The JC Whitney Catalog was on its way to becoming a do-it-yourself best seller.

Were things easier then? Of course they weren't. In fact times were tougher then. But you see, folks weren't hog-tied by business regulations and business theory. They just went on and did what they figured was right.

If that was entrepreneurship then, I reckon it's a vanished art now!

Control of the company passed to Roy after his poppa Israel died in 1943. America was at war again, the supply of civilian goods was curtailed and the demand for used auto parts grew exponentially. The retail store stood on 1900-1924 South State Street - that's an entire city block- b y 1947.

But Roy still described the biggest automotive department store in the world with the simple words "everything automotive." As the post-war years produced a crop of baby boomers, folks wanted more and bigger and safer cars to transport their progeny around. The consumer catalog broke 100 pages, spawned a series of speciality catalogs targeted to key market segments, and converted across to 24-hour ordering as successive years spurred even more growth on the catalog side of the business. Roy continuously developed new strategies to respond to changing circumstances just l ike his pappa had all those years ago. As consumer auto shows became more popular, he initiated a cooperative effort among retailers and manufacturers to make it easier for consumers to purchase independent aftermarket products.

When he saw a need for products that didn't exist, he contracted manufacturers to produce them. These effort led in turn to the formation of the Automotive Parts & Accessories Association in 1967 - and the election of Roy Warshawsky as its first President. Roy retired in 1991 a proud man. He had not only carried his father's vision forward, he had grown it too. To this day, the company proudly maintains it's dedication to the vision begun by Israel and Roy Warshawsky over 90 years ago - customer satisfaction . 1997 - Passing of a Legend In 1997 customers and staff were saddened by news of Roy Warshawsky's passing. However that same decade the company built a new forty-thousand-square-foot operations center in La Salle, Illinois t o step up service to all of its customers.

These achievements were state-of-art facilities that Roy would have applauded, for they put the power of new technology in the hands of growing staff.

Conclusion This article was about used car parts. In writing about sources for parts of cars (for instance online sites that sell car parts, salvage or junk yards etc) I hope I contributed to your understanding that auto scrapyards do play a value role in our society.
