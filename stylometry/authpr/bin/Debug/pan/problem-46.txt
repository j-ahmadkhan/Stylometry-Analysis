There are several waysto ensure that diversity is promoted in terms of managerial actsbeing conducted. Different diversity development performancemeasures can include the following steps (but are not limitedto): Manager may seek out and attend diversitydevelopment training offered by reliable institutions who arepromoting diversity. Training may include specific courses whichare helpful in the process. These course may focus on any of thefollowing: Cultivating a Diverse Workforce, or Diversity:Disability Culture & Awareness, as well as conflict resolution,diversity recruitment, diversity conferences, multiculturalnetworking, etc. Manager may also opt to establish andimplement a project on diversity development program for the workunit that is assigned to him.

The manager works with the employeesthat he is managing in order to develop a program and schedule forimplementing programs diversity development activities within thework unit that he supervises. The programs on diversity hasspecific action steps which should be followed, measurable outcomesand timelines to be able to evaluate the result of all the effortsto create diversity. A method for measuring program effectivenessis determined by means of proper evaluatory mechanisms.

Manager should be able to posses the skillsand become effective at recruiting, hiring, promoting andmaintaining a diverse workforce. This is also not just for theeasier management of the manager but also for greater effectivenessof the company. The manager must work with HR in order to instructthe employees working for the HR to hire a diverse set of peopleand not just a homogenous set of employees. A manager should alsobe able to tie up with other networks as appropriate and necessaryto assist and aid in the recruitment process and expand thediversity of the applicant pool. A promotion campaign may alsostart not just with the interview process itself but on campaignspromoting job opening of the company. The manager must ensure thatthe interview panels are diverse and trained by training programsfocused on cross-cultural interviewing techniques.

The managershould effective in mentoring all employees with career planningsupport. The manager should imbibe a sense of positive viewregarding diversity. In this way, his subordinates will be able toinherit this positive sense toward diversity. Manager should also exert effort to integratediversity development into performance of tasks, planning of futureprojects and evaluation of the past projects conducted by the team.The manager holds his staff accountable for participating inactivities that support these efforts toward the creation of a morediverse environment in the business.

The manager holds staffaccountable for undesirable behaviors that are exclusionary andoffensive to others within the groups or even for those who areoutside it. Manager models and serves as the leader inthe creation of a positive and welcoming attitude regardingdiversity. In deeds and words the manager should be able tocommunicate that diversity is indeed an asset for the company fromwhich all staff and customers benefit. He should be able toemphasize the pros of diversity which are able to outweigh the consof it, should there be any. The manager must be able to includediversity on conversations in staff meetings and even in personalconversations he conducts with his subordnates.

The manager shouldbe able to regularly include diversity discussion in communicationswith staff. In this way, the employees will have a reasonableperception that the manager is supporting this kind ofset-up. Manager provides opportunities and chancesfor staff to participate in trainings supporting diversity andother diversity related events.

The manager also seeks out and/ orcreates opportunities for his subordinates and employees to receivetraining on a variety of diversity related issues. Training willmake the employees realize among themselves the importance ofdiversity in the workplace Manager utilizes and uses the diversitywithin the workforce by the incorporation of the diverseperspectives into every business decision that the industry seeksto create and make. The manager routinely seeks out the views andperspectives of all employees. The manager uses a variety ofstrategies and methods for ensuring that the suggestions of theemployees are elicited, acknowledged and utilized in a way thatwould be beneficial to the employees.

Manager creates and maintains a workenvironment that is respectful to personal views of the workers andaccepting of diversity. The manager is able to set clearexpectations for expected reasonable behaviors and clear andcertain methods for reporting inappropriate behaviors.Inappropriate behaviors toward diversity should not be toleratedbecause it may be detrimental to the overall productivity of thecompany. There should be no discrimination among employees in spiteof the fact that there surely will be striking differences betweenand among them. Manager works to assure that the company isable to continue providing culturally competent client services. Inthis way, the company remains strong if the clients's trust ismaintained by the company. Manager sets tone and norm for creatinga welcoming workplace and environment; that is not discriminatory.The manager also assures that service delivery is provided in aculturally competent way. Services should be able to acknowledgethe differences of various cultures and still be able to work inspite of the differences. The manager assures that printed materialare available in alternate format and in different languages;bi-lingual services available and facilities are accessible for allclients.

In this way, language and cultural barriers areeffectively addressed by the company.

In various countries,states even create institutions and branches of the governmentwhere diversity will be promoted. Persons who exhibit a certainmeasure of self-confidence and motivation may seem difficult to bemanaged in secondary roles, but they most of the time find theirniche in the sectors of sales or management. Naturally creative andbold, these people value incentives, love to give their views, andprefer having regular challenges. Do not dictate to these peopleafter-the-fact. One way to harnessing the talents of theseleadership personalities lies in becoming partners with them,acknowledging their views and making them feel that they have animportant say in many matters which are work-related. This piece ofadvice is essential to keep dynamism and progress in spite ofdiversity of personalities in a workplace. Managing happened to be much easier once youknow the strategies that motivate the workers to do their best.This would entail the recognition of differences and at the sametime, the challenge to find something beneficial out of thesedifferences. A manager also must be willing to vary his approach ondoing things - at least to some certain extent.

Some employeesrespond best to objectives that are certain and clearly defined,well-defined instructions and regular feedback about theirperformance in their jobs. It may be difficult to expect thesepeople to be able to work on their own with very minimalsupervision. Thus, in the workplace, a manager should be able towork more or less, dependent on the capacity ofemployees. On the other hand, there are also others on amanager's team who expect quite the opposite, to have minimalsupervision because they prefer working alone, most of the time.The workers who are less-structured want general overviews and moreliberty and freedom to be able to make independent decisions,approaching a task from their own point of view. Requiringmandatory adherence to strict obligatory procedures ormicromanaging them lessens their creativity to a certain extent andalmost always breeds underlying and underwhelmingperformance-hindering malcontent. Knowing the appropriate management style ismost effective with each individual has another advantage: itenables a manager to be able to communicate in a way that hissubordinate will understand what he means. It's indeed a timesaver.

For example, once a manager knows that the newest hire has apersonality that is reserved, fact-oriented and analytical, themanager can feel free to get right to the point when speaking anddo so in a businesslike, diplomatic and straightforwardfashion. The manager should know that heneeds to save his anecdotes and more casual conversations forsomeone else. A reserved personality of an employee would notalways welcome a more personal approach when conversing in thebusiness setting.

There is also aCampus Diversity Initiative Communications Checklist. The steps areenumerated as the following: A campus should be able todevelop one or two primary aims for the diversity initiative andcommunicate them in a language that is easily understood both onand off the campus. In this way, the members of the institutionwill be able to understand the actual goals of the campusadministration. The administration should be ableto encourage the heads and leaders of the campus to mention theinitiative frequently in order for the listeners to become morefamiliar with the project for diversity; provide them with writtenmaterial with relevant information which they can cite in speechesand other presentations.

(The material might include updates andinformation on the initiative's progress, compelling stories whichmay motivate prospective supporters, data and analyses, a list ofissues emerging and possible to emerge across administrativedivisions and departments, and so on.) The campus should bring a team orgroup including the chancellor, president, or provost to nationaland regional conferences to explain the project. It is also veryimportant to provide the team in charge with diversity project withtalking points. In this way, other people who are interested withdiversity projects will be able to gain knowledge about diversityin an effective manner. Before, when this kind ofinstitutional project is not yet very much prevalent, the workinggroup mus be able to decide on a name for the initiative thatincorporates the key points and concepts and lends itself toabbreviation as an acronym. In this manner, it will be easier to beremembered.

Words that are catchy and easily remembered will likelyto get more attention from other people. It is also essential to be ableto develop a graphic and more visual identity for the initiative,and use it on stationery and posters and in presentations about theinitiative. Visual way of campaigning is a must as it addresses thepeople who are not very much inclined to be informed by words butby pictures. The development of a web siteabout the initiative that clearly ties into the design and formatof the "official" campus Web site will also be helpful to theprogress of the campaign. It is important to make sure theinitiative is frequently mentioned on other campus Websites. Periodic reports and updates willalso be helpful to evaluate the current status of the diversityproject. Present periodic in-person reports to leaders, governancegroups (students, staff, faculty), unions, and other keyconstituencies.

Provide periodic updates about the status of theinitiative in on-campus media (the student newspaper, e-mailmessages to faculty and staff, Web announcements, and soon). A campus may choose to issuepress releases at key junctures to off-campus media, especiallynewspapers, such as the Chronicle of Higher Education, likely tocover the initiative in detail. With press releases, people getupdated on the present tasks being done by the campusadministration One of the most important stepsin ensuring the success of every project is regularity in itsprojects. I will be useful to make regular presentations at local,regional, and national conferences about the initiative; postpresentation dates and locations on the Web site. In this way,there can be a comparison of the local from thenational. Include information about theinitiative on national diversity sites such ashttp://www.diversityweb.org. Such website and other similarwebsites will be a great help in planning the next steps in thecampus diversity project.

Write opinion pieces for nationalhigher education audiences based on experiences with theinitiative. Opinion pieces should be constructive and should ignitedevelopment for the future. It should not just contain criticismbut also suggest possible ways on how to address theshortcomings.

In WashingtonLibraries, it has been an important endeavor for the administrationof the library to encourage and celebrate diversity. The Libraries Diversity and OrganizationalCulture Task Force was tasked in March of 2004 to create adiversity plan. This is in recognition of the good benefits ofdiversity in every institution.

The Task Force reviewed andrecreated relevant UW documents and also tried looking at plans andpractices in other universities that they had access to. In 2004the Task Force surveyed the officers of the library and otherlibrary staff in order to be able to identify issues of diversitythat are important to the staff and identify areas that needattention or improvement. Survey results showed that diversity isextremely important to the staff of the library, and that the mostimportant of all issues is being able to support the diverse usercommunity effectively. It is understandable that the people who usethe library will consist of diverse groups of individuals who needto do some research. However, the staff also perceives that theLibraries can do a better job in addressing diversity issues,especially in recruiting a diverse work force and in supporting theneeds of our diverse user community.

At the same time the LibrariesDiversity TaskForce was working on the survey and plan, the University ofWashington was conducting a Diversity Appraisal. The AppraisalSteering Committee asked all units across all three campuses todocument their diversity initiatives and practices. The DiversityAppraisal is just one of many ways the UW administration is seekingto incorporate greater awareness of the issues on diversity intothe operations of the university. It is within this culture ofdiversity awareness that the Libraries Task Force has written thisplan.

Generally, the plan of diversity for libraries will beessential and would contribute to better services that can beoffered by the institution. Diversity is defined by the University ofWashington broadly to include ace, gender, disability, class,sexual identity/orientation, religion, age, ethnicity, culture,region/geography, and indigenous status. With this all-encompassingdefinition, it is really expected that almost all sectors andfactors that can be faced by the administration may be addressed bydiversity. Respect for all human diversity is on of thecore values of the Libraries and is identified among the importantvalues of the strategic plan created by the University ofWashington Library. Staff members who are able to appreciatedifferent backgrounds and perspectives are providing theadministration of the library with a competitive advantage as itapproaches problem solving and planning for services. Thisappreciation also allows the library of the University ofWashington to serve our increasingly diverse communities moreeffectively and with more sensitivity.

Beyond respect for diversity also needed torecognize that inequity can often accompany diversity. This plan ismeant to improve and support an organizational culture where thoseinequities do not occur or are remedied when identified. Libraries personnel and employees at alllevels of the organization are responsible for developing andmaintaining a culture supportive of and committed to diversity.Retention of the diverse culture should be determined and kept bythe people responsible for such projects However, in order toexpedite implementation of the plan and provide support andguidance, the Diversity Task Force recommends that theestablishment of a Diversity Officer position and a standingDiversity Committee be the first actions taken (see Goal #5). TheDiversity Officer and Committee should begin action on the ithin 6monthsitems immediately as they are of the highest priority. Theremaining action items where implementation is recommended withintwelve months should be prioritized by the Committee.

Where fundsand workload implications of others are incurred in the executionof the Plan, the responsible party(ies) will develop a plan. Theplans for the creation of diversity should be created in a way thatthey be realistic and attainable. Otherwise, the plan will notwork.
