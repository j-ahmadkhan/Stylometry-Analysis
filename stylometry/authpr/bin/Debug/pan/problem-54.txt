Critics arefound to agree that the artwork in both the anime and mangaversions of InuYasha is quite impressive , such as AnimeNews Network praising it as " excellent ". However, some viewers, such as Derrick Tucker, from THEM AnimeReviews, complain that some action scenes are often reused and thatsometimes a static image moved against a background is used as asubstitute for animation. He concedes, however, that the costs ofproducing a long anime series like InuYasha often make such compromisesunavoidable. Others have observed that thestory engages in frivolous use of reoccuring plot devices such as"barriers" and flashbacks. The story is also accused of running toolong with many irrelevant characters, storylines, and battles withno substantial character development involved. Many believe suchirrelevant battles and storylines to be filler.

The first movie, InuYasha the Movie:Affections Touching Across Time ( Eiga InuYasha: Jidai oKoeru Omoi ) was released in Japan on December 16,2001. The story begins in FeudalJapan, when the half-demon InuYasha steals the Jewel of Four Souls,a magical jewel that enhances the power of and can grant a singlewish to the one who wields it. He desires the gem so that he canturn himself into a full-blooded demon. InuYasha does not get farbefore Kikyo, the young miko of the village, shoots him with asacred arrow that seals him against Goshinboku, a sacred tree inthe nearby forest. Mortally wounded, Kikyo tells her youngersister, Kaede, to burn the jewel in her funeral pyre, thuspreventing it from falling into the hands of evil. In modern Tokyo, a junior-high school-girl namedKagome Higurashi is on her way to school. She stops in the wellhouse of her family's Shinto shrine to retrieve her cat, Buyo, whena centipede demon crawls from the well and drags her into theSengoku period of Japan. Lost, Kagome wanders around the forest near theBone Eater's Well. She spots Goshinboku away in the distance andheads towards it. On the tree, she finds InuYasha, still sealed inan enchanted sleep. Villagers capture her and take her to the oldpriestess, Kaede. Realising that Kagome is the reincarnation of hersister, Kikyo, Kaede tells her the story of Kikyo andInuYasha. The centipede attacks again, and Kagome is forcedto free InuYasha from his enchantment so he can destroy it. Afterkilling the centipede, InuYasha tries to take the Jewel of FourSouls from Kagome. In order to stop InuYasha, and to save Kagome'slife, Kaede places magical prayer beads around InuYasha's neck sothat Kagome can command him. The Jewel of Four Souls attracts more demons, andin a battle against a carrion crow demon, the jewel is shatteredinto innumerable shards that scatter all across Japan. As theshards are capable of granting those who embed it in their bodiesgreat power, it is sought after by many demons as well as somehumans. Kagome and InuYasha set out to gather the shardsand restore the Jewel of Four Souls. Along the way, they befriendShippo, a fox demon; Miroku, a cursed monk; and Sango, ademon-slayer whose brother was possessed and forced to slaughtertheir father and the other demon slayers. The group meets manyfriends and foes during their adventures, including InuYasha'solder half-brother Sesshomaru; Kikyo, who died 50 years ago but,was resurrected with part of Kagome's soul; Naraku, who trickedKikyo and InuYasha into turning against each other; and a wolfdemon named Koga, who is in love with Kagome and whenever he andInuYasha meet they constantly bicker. Eventually, the Shikon jewel is reassembled byNaraku, who is then destroyed by InuYasha. Before he dies, Narakumakes a wish on the jewel that Kagome would replace the soul ofMidoriko, the jewel's original creator, within the jewel and thathis soul would also enter the jewel so he could survive inside asher enemy. This would only work if Kagome made a selfish wish,which Naraku tries to trick her into doing, but confident thatInuYasha would rescue her, she refuses to do so. InuYasha rescuesher and Kagome wishes for the jewel to vanish forever. Kagome is thrown back into her own time, andInuYasha is no longer able to see her. However, after three yearswhen Kagome has graduated high school, a portal opens allowing herto return to InuYasha's time. They acknowledge their love for oneanother and she chooses to remain in the past withhim. Kagome is thegranddaughter of the keeper of the Higurashi shrine, which is aShinto shrine near Tokyo. On her fifteenth birthday, Kagome triesto save her cat from falling down the shrine well and she is pulledinto the Bone Eater's well by Mistress Centipede who wanted theShikon Jewel, which was hidden in her body.This takes her back in time to the Warring States Period (SengokuJidai) of Japan, where she finds the half demon,InuYasha. She is the reincarnation of thepriestess Kikyo, who died 500 years before the start of the series,and she takes over Kikyo's task of protecting the Shikon Jewel, butaccidentally shatters it with her arrow.

Miroku Miroku is a Buddhist monk who traveled thecountryside performing (mostly faked) services such as exorcismsand demon exterminations to earn his living. He suffers from ahereditary curse originally inflicted upon his grandfather byNaraku. The hole in his hand becomes a Wind Tunnel, which sucks inalmost anything in its path. The Wind Tunnel proves to be apowerful weapon against demons, but grows larger as timepasses. He joins InuYasha and Kagome inhopes that he will be able to find and kill Naraku so he can breakthe curse before it consumes him, as it consumed his grandfatherand father. Miroku also uses his holystaff and several scrolls to attack enemies. He first meets InuYasha after he steals theShikon Jewel. InuYasha attacks Miroku and Miroku quickly uses hisWind Tunnel. Realizing he won't harm humans, Kagome stands in hispath. Miroku quickly covers the Wind Tunnel, and after explaininghis situation, InuYasha allows him to join their group. Miroku hasa habit of asking random women to bear his child so that, in thecase that he would die defeating Naraku, he would have an heir. Arunning gag is Miroku's lechery, specifically shameless flatteryand occasional groping with varying subtlety. After his father haddied, Miroku was raised by a monk, and learned his lecheroustendencies from him. At the end of the series, Miroku is no longerbearing the wind tunnel, and marries Sango. They have threechildren, twin girls and a boy. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by KojiTsujitani. In the English dub, he is voiced by KirbyMorrow.

Sango and thesouls of the purified demons of Hiraikotsu share a deep connection,and when she puts the weapon in danger to save Miroku, they chideher for it and ask that she put them above him. Sango's family was killed and her entirevillage destroyed by Naraku's demons so Naraku could steal theirShikon Jewel shards. He then blames InuYasha and manipulates Sangointo trying to kill him. When the ploy failed, Naraku uses a shardof the Shikon Jewel to revive and control Sango's little brotherKohaku, forcing him to fight InuYasha and his company, and usinghim to manipulate Sango. She seeks vengeance against Naraku, buther primary goal is to rescue Kohaku from Naraku's influence andsave his life. Sango is often the victim of Miroku'slecherous tendencies, and continually slaps him for it. However,she later confesses her love for him and the two get engaged.

In herfull demon form, Kirara is capable of flying, an ability InuYasha'sgroup find useful for transporting Sango, Miroku, and Shippo whenInuYasha is running quickly or jumping to greater heights than theywould normally be able to keep up with. For most of the series,Kirara stays with Sango and aids InuYasha's group in battles. Atthe end of the series as Naraku has been defeated, she chooses tojoin Kohaku as he trains to become a demon slayer while Sangostarts her new life with Miroku and their children.

Hisother noteworthy abilities are turning into a large pink flyingballoon, illusionary tricks with toys like his giant spinning topattack, weak fox fire magic, and making things multiply. He tendsto be naïvely observant and often makes pointed and cheeky commentstowards InuYasha, earning him a retaliatory bonk on the head.InuYasha and Kagome serve as older sibling figures toShippo.

Heis responsible for many of the characters' suffering, including thedeath of Kikyo and the sealing of InuYasha to the sacred tree.Naraku originated from a bandit named Onigumo, who made a deal withseveral demons in order to receive a new body so he may pursue hiscaretaker, Kikyo and gain possession of the Shikon Jewel.Throughout the series', Naraku has created many detachments, to aidhim in goal of killing those who oppose him and finding the shardsof the Shikon Jewel. In the anime adaptation, he is his voiced byToshiyuki Morikawa. In the English dub, he is voiced by PaulDobson. Naraku's detatchments are: Kanna - the first detachment of Naraku.

Once a soul is trapped within her mirror, Kanna can controltheir host bodies to carry out her bidding. The mirror also has theability to create a glass demon that can copy the abilities ofwhatever it reflects, though Kanna receives all damage in the glassdemon's stead . In her last battle, Kannais ordered by Naraku to commit suicide, shattering herself and theglass demon she was currently using into thousands of tiny shards.One of the shards hits Kagome's right eye, and Kanna directs herfinal thought to tell Kagome how to destroy Naraku. Kagura hatesher creator and wishes to be free from him. After Kagura helpsKohaku escape from Naraku, Naraku mockingly returns her heartbefore fatally attacking her and leaving her to die. Kagura - his second detachment. A wind sorceress, Kaguraprimarily uses a wind-manipulating fan to enhance her powers andcreate wind-based attacks, including a blade-like tornado attackand using wind to animate dead bodies. She can also use a pair offeathers that she wears in her hair for transportation, enlargingthem then using them to ride in the wind. Goshinki - Naraku'sthird detachment takes the form of a large horned purple demon.Goshinki has the ability to read the thoughts of others, whichenables him to outmaneuver InuYasha. Goshinki breaks the Tetsusaigaby biting it, however, this ultimately results in his death at theclaws of InuYasha. Kage romaru - the fou rthdetachment, is a tiny slithering creature with a human head and twoscythed-arms. Despite his form, Kager maru is quite fast, and canalso tunnel in the ground. He resides in Juromaru's stomach, who isloyal only to him, where he can make surprise attacks on theenemy. Juromaru - the fifthincarnation is perhaps the least loyal of all of the incarnationNaraku creates. Juromaru's only loyalty is his elder brotherKageromaru, who is hidden in Juromaru's stomach when covered by ametal mask. Juromaru has little intelligence and never speaks,characterized only by a lust to kill. He and his elder brother werekilled by InuYasha and Koga. Muso - the sixth detachment of Naraku was separated from Naraku in his attempt toremove his human side, Onigumo, which would also remove Onigumo'slove for Kikyo. Naraku cared so little for the incarnation heneither named it or gave it a face. Muso took both his name andface from a wandering monk he slew. Naraku quickly realizes,however, that he cannot abandon Onigumo so easily, and Muso wasabsorbed back into Naraku. The Infant -Naraku's heart and seventh detachment is capable of speakingfluently. He is a baby that can possess anyone with the darkness intheir heart. His main goal is to control Kagome's mind by findingthe pain, anger, or jealousy within her heart, and use herabilities to find the remaining shards of the Shikon Jewel. TheInfant is not loyal to Naraku and is destroyed along with Moryomaruby Naraku. Hakudoshi - theeighth detachment from Naraku is created from The Infant's body, hewas Entei's final master and takes the form of a young child.

Over time,both The Infant and Hakudoshi grow tired of Naraku's rule overthem, and seek to betray and overthrow him. Naraku eventuallyrealized their wish, however, and instructs his Saimyosho toabandon Hakudoshi in battle, giving him no protection againstMiroku's Wind Tunnel, and he is destroyed. Byakuya - Naraku'sninth and final detachment is meant to replace Kagura. He is loyalto Naraku and has an incredible power of creating illusions.Byakuya has the power to possess people with paper soldiers, summonvines to entrap his enemies, teleport others to differentdimensions, detach organs from his body, and erectb arriers. He travels on a giant origamipaper crane. When InuYasha attacks him with his Meidou Zangetsuha,Byakuya is absorbed into it. The other members of Naraku's groupare: Kohaku Kohaku is Sango's younger brother, who wasonce under the control of Naraku.

Sango survived solely by sheer luck.Castle guards killed Kohaku that night, only to have him laterresurrected by Naraku as an amnesiac puppet. After severalencounters with Sango and her friends, he began to recover hispainful memories and sought to secretly find a way to destroyNaraku while still maintaining the illusion of being under hiscontrol; he later formed an alliance with Kagura, who soughtfreedom from Naraku's tyranny. Following Kagura's death, he joins Kikyo ashe believes travelling with her is the only way to redeem himself.He remains by her side until she tells him to separate from her forfear of being unable to keep his shard pure. However, he is nearlycaptured by Byakuya, and only a timely arrival bySesshomaru saveshim. Kohaku remains with Sesshomaru's group after this, and helpsprotect Rin, who he has a friendship with.

He is givento Kanna, who places The Infant inside of him, giving MoryomaruNaraku's physical life force. Moryomaru begins to increase more andmore in power as he absorbs different demons to gain theirabilities. During a battle, he nearly defeats anonslaught of most of Naraku's enemies which included Kikyo, Kohaku,Kagome, InuYasha, Miroku, Sango, Shippo, and Sesshomaru.
