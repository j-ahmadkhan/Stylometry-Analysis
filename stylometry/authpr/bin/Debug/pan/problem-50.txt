LoweringResting Heart Rate For athletes, a low resting heart rate is usually a sign of goodhealth, though for those who are extremely sedentary it can be asign of heart disease. 1. Stay hydrated Drinking water isn't just good for your skinand your digestive tract, it helps keep your blood flowing throughyour veins as well. Eight glasses of water a day is the generalrule, but you should increase that if you live in an extremely dryclimate, or routinely engage in extreme physicalactivity. 2. This may be a little bit delicate, but it'sreally important to your heart, as well as your kidneys, to relieveyourself when you feel the urge. Don't hold it. A full bladderstresses your entire circulatory system, and can increase yourheart rate by up to nine beats per minute.

3. Get some rest An Australian study that involved rousingvolunteers from their sleep many times a night (often with loudnoises) found that being startled from sleep can increase yourheart rate by 13 beats per minutes. 4. Meditate or relax Massage, meditation, a warm bubble bath -anything that puts you into a relaxed state also reduces yourresting heart rate. A British study even found that when volunteersreceived hour-long reflexology treatments, their resting heartrates decreased by an average of eight beats perminute. 5. Exercise regularly Cardiovascular exercises, such as, running,swimming and biking.

These exercises increase heart's efficiency,thus, reducing the number of beats per minute required for thecirculatory system to function whether in active or restingstate. If you're already exercising routinely,consider increasing the intensity of your cardiovascular workouts:if you're already walking, jog. If you're a jogger, start running.The trick is to vary the pace: do three minutes at 70% of yourmaximum heart rate, followed by four at 90%.

ExerciseProtocols and Precautions People should consult their doctors beforebeginning competitive sports or an exercise program. Doctors askabout known medical disorders in the person and family members andsymptoms the person has. They do a physical examination, includinglistening to the heart with a stethoscope. This evaluationidentifies some of the rare young people who could have apreviously unsuspected heart disorder that can lead to seriousheart rhythm abnormalities or sudden, unexpected death withstrenuous exercise. It also detects conditions that could restrictactivities. For example, overweight people are more likely todevelop musculoskeletal injuries after activities involving suddenstarts and stops (such as tennis and basketball) as well as thosethat involve impact (such as jogging).

People older than age 40 who are starting anexercise program should report any diagnoses of heart disorders orarthritis and describe any symptoms of chest pain, shortness ofbreath, leg pains with walking, palpitations (awareness ofheartbeat) or irregular heartbeats, joint pain or swelling, andinability to exercise for long periods (for example, because ofweakness, shortness of breath, sweating, or leg pains). Certaindrugs may limit the ability to exercise, such as beta-blockers,which slow heart rate, and sedatives, which can cause drowsinessand increase the risk of falling. Did You Know...

The maximum possible benefit from aerobicexercise can be obtained by doing just 10 to 15 minutes of intervalcycling a few times a week. Tension time (how long a set lasts) may bethe best way to gauge how much weight to use when strengthtraining. Stretching exercises are more beneficialwhen done after rather than before other exercises. Sustained, high-intensity weight trainingcan be at least as beneficial for the heart as aerobicexercise. Conditions that make exercise too risky torecommend in children include heart inflammation (myocarditis),which is uncommon. It increases the risk of sudden death due toheart dysfunction.

Fever is another, because it impairs ability toexercise, may be a sign of serious illness, and may lead toheat-related illness such as heatstroke. Conditions that lead todehydration (for example, vomiting and diarrhea) are also risky,because sweating during exercise can worsen dehydration. Conditions that make exercise too risky torecommend and that occur mainly in adults include angina pectorisand a heart attack in the previous 6 weeks. Precautions for CertainConditions People with cystic fibrosis or diabetes,which can lead to dehydration, should drink large amounts of fluidsaround the time of exercise. People who have had several concussions ora recent concussion should avoid contact sports. People with seizures should avoid swimmingand weight lifting alone to prevent injuring themselves and shouldavoid riflery and archery to prevent injuring others. People with an enlarged spleen (forexample, after infectious mononucleosis) should avoid contactsports because being hit or falling may rupture the enlargedspleen. Doctors can provide specific instructions onthe type of activity as well as the level of intensity (how hardthe exercise should be), the duration of activity (how long theexercise should last), and the frequency (how often the exerciseshould be done).

In some cases, exercise should be supervised by aphysical therapist or other health care practitioner or by anexperienced, licensed fitness professional. The safest way to start an exercise programis to do the chosen exercise or sport at a low intensity of effort.Beginning at a low intensity allows time to learn proper bodymechanics, which helps to prevent future injuries when training ata higher intensity. Beginning at a low intensity also preventsexcessive muscle strain. The exercise should be done until the legsor arms ache or feel heavy. If muscles ache after just a fewminutes, the first workout should last only that long. As fitnessincreases, a person should be able to exercise longer withoutfeeling muscle pain. However, some discomfort is necessary fordeveloping stronger, larger muscles.

Over time, a person canincrease exercise demands as needed or required to achieve fitnessgoals. Screeningfor Sports Participation Most schools and organized sportsorganizations require that people have a doctor evaluate whetherthey can safely participate before they join the program. Doctorsask questions about general health and do an examination aspreviously described.

Adolescents and young adults are often askedabout use of illicit and performance-enhancing drugs. (See also theUS Anti-Doping Agency web site.) In girls and women, doctors lookfor delays in the onset of menarche and presence of the femaleathlete triad (eating disorders, amenorrhea or other menstrualdysfunction, and diminished bone mineral density), which isbecoming more common as more adolescent and young women engage inoverly intensive physical activity and overly zealous loss of bodyfat. Typesof Exercise A major distinction among different types ofexercise is whether they are aerobic (low intensity, steady state)or strength training (also sometimes called anaerobic exercise).Most forms of exercise have components of both. Aerobic Exercise This term refers to exercise that requires more than theusual amount of oxygen to get to the muscles, thus the heart andlungs are forced to work harder. Running, biking, swimming,skating, and using aerobic exercise machines (such as treadmill,stair-climbing, and elliptical training machines) are activitiesthat people do to experience aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercisetends to expend a great deal of calories, improves cardiacfunction, and decreases slightly the risk of death from cardiaccauses.

However, it is less effective than strength training atbuilding strength and muscle mass. Too much weight-bearing aerobicexercise causes excessive wear on the joints and surroundingtissues, so trying to improve muscle strength through frequent,repetitive bouts of aerobic activity must be done cautiously if atall. For aerobic exercise to benefit the heart, oxygen useshould be increased to a rate that is within about 15 to 40% of themaximum rate the body can sustain. This maximum rate can beestimated in several ways: The heart rate increases by 20 beats per minute more thanthe resting heart rate. Exercise is accompanied by reasonably heavy breathing andsweating, presuming that the environmental temperature is notinordinately hot. A "target" heart rate is reached. A typical recommendation is to do 30 minutes of aerobicexercise at sufficient intensity about 2 to 3 times per week, with5-minute warm-up (gradual increase to peak intensity) and 5-minutecool-down (gradual decrease in intensity) periods.

However, the30-minute length of time is arbitrary. Maximum aerobic conditioningcan be achieved by doing as little as 10 to 15 minutes of activityper session 2 to 3 times per week if interval cycling is used. Ininterval cycling, moderate aerobic exercise is alternated withintense exertion. For example, about 90 seconds of moderateactivity (60 to 80% of maximum heart rate) is alternated with 20 to30 seconds of all-out sprinting (85 to 95% of maximum heart rate oras hard as the person can exercise while maintaining correctexercise form. Sprinting, however, can strain joints and thusshould be done for only limited times and perhaps be avoidedcompletely if joint pain occurs or if the person has certain jointdisorders. Proper body mechanics should be maintained to avoidinjury. Sometimes aerobic exercise can be done while strengthtraining (for example, if little time is taken to rest betweendoing strength training exercises).

Different aerobic exercises work different muscle groups.For example, running works primarily the lower leg muscles. Landingon the heels and rising on the toes exerts the greatest force onthe ankle. Riding a bicycle works primarily the upper leg musclesbecause pedaling works the front thigh muscles (quadriceps) andhips. Rowing and swimming work the upper body and the backpredominantly. These exercises can be alternated daily to avoidinjury. 2. AnaerobicExercise or Resistance Training Strength training involves forceful muscular contractionagainst resistance, usually using free or machine weights.Depending on how it is done, strength training may be somewhat lessbeneficial for cardiovascular fitness than aerobic exercise.However, it develops muscle strength, size, endurance, andflexibility and still benefits the heart and lungs. In the longrun, increased muscle mass helps a person become leaner and loseweight, because muscle uses more calories, even at rest, than doother types of tissues, particularly fat. More muscle mass alsomeans more functional ability into later years, which helps peopleremain independent as they age.

Individual exercises are designed to strengthen particularmuscles or muscle groups. Usually, larger muscle groups areexercised first, then smaller ones. Maximum benefit is obtained byexercising at a high workload, but not necessarily to failure (thatis, the point at which another repetition in good form isimpossible). Traditionally, particular exercises are done in sets.Each set includes 8 to 12 repetitions of the exercise, donecontinuously (that is, no rest, including joint "locking," betweenrepetitions). The amount of weight used is the maximum that theperson can use and still do 8 to 12 repetitions in a relativelyslow and controlled manner, without heaving, throwing, or droppingthe weight. Doing one set with steady tension results in about 75to 85% of the benefit of doing 3 sets, the maximumrecommended. Tension time is another way to determine recommended muscleworkload (the amount of weight lifted and the amount of work themuscle does).

Tension time refers to the total duration of liftingand lowering the weight in one set. Tension time should be brieferif the goal is moderate exercise and building strength than if thegoal is more muscular endurance than strength (for example, duringrehabilitation from injury). Tension time is a better way to gaugerecommended muscle workload for increasing strength than are setsand repetitions. To continue to increase strength, after therecommended tension time is achieved with good technique, weightshould be increased to the maximum at which the person can maintainor be challenged again with the same tension time. Recommendedtension time is ideally 40 to 60 seconds for the upper body and,because the lower body has greater endurance, about 60 to 90seconds for the lower body. If the goal is muscular endurance,tension time is usually about 90 to 120 seconds. Strength athletes,such as power lifters, respond better and favor briefer tensiontimes of 10 to 30 seconds, since the concurrently heavier loadsstimulate superior strength increases, although with less musclegrowth and endurance responses.

Frequency of exercise is a critical factor. Muscles start tobreak down when exercised at sufficient workloads more often thanevery other day. The day after an adequate workout, bleeding andmicroscopic tearing occur in muscle fibers, which is probably whymuscles feel sore.

This soreness (also called an alarm reaction)stimulates muscles to repair themselves and grow to adapt to ahigher state of function. Exercisers should allow about 48 hoursfor muscles to recover after exercise. After very vigorousexercise, a muscle group may take several days to heal completely,thus allowing the muscles to heal and to become stronger. Hence, instrength training, it is usually best to alternate the musclegroups being exercised.

An ideal schedule, for example, alternatesexercise for the upper body on one day with exercise for the lowerbody on the next, with each muscle trained no more than twice perweek. The more intense and the more exercise done for a muscle, theless often it should be worked. People who train with a very highlevel of intensity of effort likely should not train each muscleany more than once a week.

Injury rehabilitation may not aim for development of largemuscles. Exercising with less weight but increased numbers ofrepetitions can increase strength and endurance, provide someaerobic exercise, and increase blood flow to the area, whichaccelerates healing. This approach may be tolerated better thanexercising muscles more intensely, which requires a high degree ofmotivation. Once confidence and function increase in the injuredperson, intensity of effort and work loads should increase in orderto optimize results.

In circuit training, the largemuscles of the legs, hips, back, and chest are exercised followedby the smaller muscles of the shoulders, arms, abdomen, and neck.Some people prefer to train legs last since they require so muchenergy and are so fatiguing to work. Circuit training of only 15 to20 minutes can benefit the cardiovascular system more than joggingor using aerobic exercise machines for the same time. The workoutis often more intense, and heart rate can increase even more as aresult. Safe technique is important. Jerkingor dropping weights can cause minor injury due to sudden starts andstops. Controlled breathing prevents dizziness (and, in extremecases, fainting), which can occur when forcefully exhaling orbearing down. Specifically, people should exhale while lifting aweight and inhale when lowering a weight.

If a movement is slow,such as lowering a weight for 5 seconds or longer, people may needto breathe in and out more than once, but breathing should still becoordinated so that a final breath is taken in just before thelifting phase and released during lifting. Blood pressure increasesduring resistance training, particularly when working the largemuscles of the lower body and while gripping very hard with thehands, as can be experienced when doing the leg press exercise.However, blood pressure returns to normal quickly after exercise.And the increase in blood pressure is smaller when breathingtechnique is correct, no matter how hard a person exerts. Mostpeople who intend to lift weights benefit from initial supervisionthat includes instruction on how to set the weights and seatlevels, how to maintain proper body mechanics, and how to breatheduring exercises. Having a professional trainer observe the personas the exercise is being done is usually most helpful, so thatimproper mechanics can be identified and corrected. 3. StretchingandFlexibility Stretching reduces stiffness of muscles and tendons andthereby improves flexibility. Flexibility is important forcomfortable performance of physical activities. Although stretchingitself does not strengthen muscles, it can increase the area overwhich the muscle contracts, which allows muscle force to be exertedmore effectively and with less risk of injury.

Stretching may helppeople jump higher, lift heavier weights, run faster, and throwfarther. Specific flexibility exercises involve slowly andsteadily stretching groups of muscles without jerking, bouncing, orcausing excess pain (minor discomfort is normal when stretchingcurrent limits of a joint, but pain should never be intolerable).These exercises can be done before or after other forms of trainingor as a program itself, as occurs in yoga and Pilates sessions.Although stretching before exercise enhances mental preparedness,there is no evidence that stretching decreases risk of injury.General warming-up (for example, with low-intensity simulation ofthe exercise to be performed, jogging on the spot, calisthenics, orother light activities that increase core temperature) appears tobe more effective than stretching for facilitating safe exercise.Stretching after exercise is preferred because tissues stretch moreeffectively when warmed. Workload andVariation In general, if the intensity of anexercise increases, duration, frequency, or both may need todecrease and vice versa. For most people who participate in weighttraining, the amount of weight lifted should continue to increaseas they get stronger, whereas duration and frequency typicallyremain constant once a certain level is reached. Exercise thatinvolves too low a workload provides fewer rewards. Exercise thatinvolves too high a workload increases risk of improper mechanicsand thus injury.

Additionally, people should vary the way theytrain their muscles over time. The body adapts to routine, so thatdoing the same exercises in the same way over time becomes lesseffective in building strength, muscle, and cardiovascular fitness.Therefore, people who engage in resistance exercises should altertheir routines every few weeks, and aerobic exercisers shouldalternate among the different forms of aerobic exerciseavailable.

Medications Beta blockers (sometimes written as -blocker) are aclass of drugs used for various indications, but particularly forthe management of cardiac arrhythmias, cardioprotection aftermyocardial infarction (heart attack), and hypertension. Propranolol was the first clinically useful betaadrenergic receptor antagonist. Invented by Sir James W. Black, itrevolutionized the medical management of angina pectoris and isconsidered to be one of the most important contributions toclinical medicine and pharmacology of the 20th century. Beta blockers may also be referred to asbeta-adrenergic blocking agents, beta-adrenergic antagonists, orbeta antagonists. Beta blockers decrease nocturnal melatonin release,perhaps partly accounting for sleep disturbance caused by someagents.

Beta blockers protect against social anxiety:"Improvement of physical symptoms has been demonstrated withbeta-blockers such as propranolol; however, these effects arelimited to the social anxiety experienced in performancesituations." (example- an inexperienced symphony soloist) Beta blockers can impair the relaxation of bronchialmuscle (mediated by beta-2) and so should be avoided byasthmatics. They can also be used to treat glaucoma because theydecrease intraocular pressure by lowering aqueous humorsecretion. Clinical Use Large differences exist in the pharmacology ofagents within the class, thus not all beta blockers are used forall indications listed below. Indications for beta blockers include: Hypertension Angina Mitral valve prolapse Cardiac arrhythmia Atrial fibrillation Congestive heart failure Myocardial infarction Glaucoma Migraine prophylaxis Symptomatic control (tachycardia, tremor) in anxiety andhyperthyroidism Essential tremor Phaeochromocytoma, in conjunction with-blocker Beta blockers have also been used in the followingconditions: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy Acute dissecting aortic aneurysm Marfan syndrome (chronic treatment with propranolol slowsprogression of aortic dilation and its complications) Prevention of variceal bleeding in portalhypertension Possible mitigation of hyperhidrosis Social anxiety disorder and other anxietydisorders Adverse effects Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with theuse of beta blockers include: nausea, diarrhea, bronchospasm,dyspnea, cold extremities, exacerbation of Raynaud's syndrome,bradycardia, hypotension, heart failure, heart block, fatigue,dizziness, abnormal vision, decreased concentration,hallucinations, insomnia, nightmares, clinical depression, sexualdysfunction, erectile dysfunction and/or alteration of glucose andlipid metabolism. Mixed 1/ -antagonist therapy is also commonlyassociated with orthostatic hypotension. Carvedilol therapy iscommonly associated with edema.

Central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects(hallucinations, insomnia, nightmares, depression) are more commonin agents with greater lipid solubility, which are able to crossthe blood-brain barrier into the CNS. Similarly, CNS adverseeffects are less common in agents with greater aqueous solubility(listed below). Adverse effects associated with 2-adrenergicreceptor antagonist activity (bronchospasm, peripheralvasoconstriction, alteration of glucose and lipid metabolism) areless common with 1-selective (often termed "cardioselective")agents, however receptor selectivity diminishes at higher doses.Beta blockade, especially of the beta-1 receptor at the maculadensa inhibits renin release, thus decreasing the release ofaldosterone. This causes hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. A 2007 study revealed that diuretics andbeta-blockers used for hypertension increase a patient's risk ofdeveloping diabetes while ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin IIreceptor antagonists (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers) actuallydecrease the risk of diabetes.

Clinical guidelines in GreatBritain, but not in the United States, call for avoiding diureticsand beta-blockers as first-line treatment of hypertension due tothe risk of diabetes. Beta blockers must not be used in thetreatment of cocaine, amphetamine, or other alpha adrenergicstimulant overdose. The blockade of only beta receptors increaseshypertension, reduces coronary blood flow, left ventricularfunction, and cardiac output and tissue perfusion by means ofleaving the alpha adrenergic system stimulation unopposed. Theappropriate antihypertensive drugs to administer duringhypertensive crisis resulting from stimulant abuse are vasodilatorslike nitroglycerin, diuretics like furosemide and alpha blockerslike phentolamine.
