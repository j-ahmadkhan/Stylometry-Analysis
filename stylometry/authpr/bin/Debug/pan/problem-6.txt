Which is all well and good, but that's all about improving your self-discipline. What do you do when you aren't even that far yet? Start small Did you see the first example I gave: eat an apple every day? Start with that. Eat an apple every day for the rest of this week or, if you don't like apples, pick a healthy fruit that you do like, go out and buy 7 today, and eat one every day until next week's post. If you can do that, you've found your hidden wellspring of self-discipline, and getting your life/home/job/whatever organised is truly within your grasp. Next week, we'll be taking a look at your nemesis and mine, the Daily Planner. Week 2: The Daily Planner It lies there on the desk, taunting you, mocking you. "Use me," it whispers in the night. "You know you want to." And you do want to use that beautiful daily planner, the one you found in the stationary store, with the silky-smooth cover, the elegant binding, the pristine pages just waited to mark out your life. It fits perfectly into your favourite bag, and even comes with its own pen, slotted handily into the side, so you'll never be unable to write when you need to. It was made for you, and you knew it the moment you laid eyes on it. It was destiny. And it's been lying untouched on the kitchen table ever since you brought it home. Guilt-tripping you through every meal you've eaten since that fateful day you bought it. Unfortunately, the Bottom Line is that a daily planner is a must if you want to stay organized. And you actually need to use it, too. Very few people have the brain capacity to store and remember every day-to-day event, appointment and task. Consequently, we forget important to-do's. That is where the daily planner comes in to act as our reminder. The bottom line is that everyone can benefit from a daily planner. Pros Recording your appointments help to prevent you from forgetting about them or being late Recording bill due dates helps to prevent late or forgotten payments Use your planner to schedule exercise or "me" time Recording birthdays and special events will help you to never forget those occasions Keep track of tasks and daily to do's that are so easy to forget if not written down Cons If you don't utilize a daily planner you will be disorganized! I can't imagine living without a daily planner, now. I never used to have one, until I finally gave in and tried for a short period of time, and to my great surprise, it worked! Now, without one, my organisational abilities fly out the window. I forget important events, appointments and tasks, and my mind feels all scattered and in disarray. Once I resume using my daily planner, my organisational abilities fall back into place. Now, I view it everyday and night making sure I attended to or completed the tasks, appointments or events, and I review the events of the following day. It is an essential item for me to stay organized. While I love my personal organizer, there are numerous styles available in various price ranges, colors and capabilities, and that is why I am not suggesting one particular kind. The one that will work perfectly for you is the one that you select and that you commit to using on a regular basis. It is imperative to maintaining organization. So the task for this week, if you don't already have the perfect daily planner lying around begging to be used, is to get Or ganized by investing in a daily planner. Be Organized using a daily planner, and s tay Organized using your daily planner on a daily basis. In other words, spend some time this week in a stationer's, find a daily planner that you really like the style and layout of. It doesn't matter if you don't have a clue how you're supposed to use it, or even if you can't figure out what is meant to go in it. Your instinct is a better judge than you on this matter, so just buy the one that really makes you think, "Ooo". If you want to start using your planner at once, feel free. Otherwise, we'll get started on that next week. Oh, and keep eating those apples. Can't let your self-discipline wander off after the first butterfly that flutters by, now that you've finally roped it in. Week 3: Set Aside Time to be Organised Last week, we got ourselves a cool new Shiny! This week, we're going to use it to take concrete steps to organising whatever it is you want to organise. This is going to take time, and you are going to have to set aside time to do it. That's the hard part. That's why these posts are going out on Mondays, so you have a chance to plan ahead-weekends are great for setting aside time, if you know a few days in advance that you're going to need it. So call this a head's up. The Problem with "stuff" There is a book you've probably heard of: Getting Things Done . It's a pretty good book to have if you're going to organise stuff, because it does work. Getting Things Done succeeds because it first addresses a critical barrier to co mpleting the atomic tasks that we want to accomplish in a given day. That barrier is "stuff". Amorphous, unactionable, flop-sweat-inducing stuff. The author David Allen says: Here's how I define "stuff:" anything you have allowed into your psychological or physical world that doesn't belong where it is, but for which you haven't yet determined the desired outcome and the next action step. [pg. 17] Stuff is bouncing around in our heads and causing untold stress and anxiety. Evaluation meetings, bar mitzvahs, empty rolls of toilet paper, broken lawn mowers, college applications, your big gut, tooth decay, dirty underwear and imminent jury duty all compete for prime attention in our poor, addled brains. Stuff has no "home" and, consequently, no place to go, so it just keeps rattling around. Worst off, we're too neurotic to stop thinking about it, and we certainly don't have time to actually do everything in one day. Jeez Louise, what the hell am I, Superman? So, you sprint from fire to fire, praying you haven't forgotten anything, sapped of anything like creativity or even the basic human flexibility to adapt your own schedule to the needs of your friends, your family or yourself. Your "stuff" has taken over your brain like a virus now, dragging down every process it touches and rendering you spent and virtually useless. Sound familiar? So how does GTD work? This is a really summarized version, but here it is, PowerPoint-style: identify all the stuff in your life that isn't in the right place (close all open loops) get rid of the stuff that isn't yours or you don't need right now create a right place that you trust and that supports your working style and values put your stuff in the right place, consistently do your stuff in a way that honors your time, your energy, and the context of any given moment iterate and refactor mercilessly So, basically, you make your stuff into real, actionable items or things you can just get rid of. Everything you keep has a clear reason for being in your life at any given moment-both now and well into the future. This gives you an amazing kind of confidence that a) nothing gets lost and b) you always understand what's on or off your plate. Also built-in to the system are an ongoing series of reviews, in which you periodically re-examine your now-organized stuff from various levels of granularity to make sure your vertical focus (individual projects and their tasks) is working in concert with your horizontal focus (side to side scanning of all incoming channels for new stuff). It's actually sort of fun and oddly satisfying. In Greek mythology, Chaos is the name of the goddess of emptiness and confusion, a shapeless void who gave birth to the universe. Yet chaos also provides the opportunity for growth and change and creativity. And chaos-both the goddess and the state of being-is fertile and alive, unlike order, which is sterile and inanimate. If we always choose to stay home and get organised, our lives will be dull. Life isn't intended to be boxed, labeled and put on a shelf. For some of us, however, organising is a pleasure. Before I start my work, I need to clear my desk to feel the literal and figurative space to create. Without that peace of mind, my energy is drained by thinking about what still needs to be done. As with all things in life (and my friend constantly reminds me of this), the answer is in finding a balance between chaos and order. A house without sticky fingerprints is missing a child's laughter. A kitchen without dirty dishes lacks homemade meals. In all life there is evidence of living. Sometimes that evidence looks like clutter; sometimes it looks like the reason to be grateful for the abundance in your home. So before you start attacking every mess, grouching at your kids or partner and forgetting to actually see out of the window you're so intent on cleaning, look around and consider: Is all that surrounds you clutter-or abundance?
