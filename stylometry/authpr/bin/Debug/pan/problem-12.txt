Not sure how you feel about these these things, however I personally enjoy sensing the spirits of the departed when I visit historic sites. It may sound crazy, however I actually have a sense of communing with those souls. Take Arthur Stilwell for example who founded the old KCS. Would you believe he write the following poem too. Now I've heard folk like professors say it's wrong to copy on the internet. However I figure Arthur wrote it the way he wanted, and that it would be disrespectful of me to change it, no matter what all the academics have to say. THE DAY OF PEACE A Poem by Arthur E. Stilwell I see the coming, dawning day, The peaceful, restful hour When Light shall hold all earth And only Love has power. I hear the voice of angels, From distant days of old, Of peace on earth to man, To waking shepherds told. I see all barriers broken Of race and class and creeds And man is only judged By the kindness of his deeds; I see all armies melt A the sword shall lose its power In the glorious day of Peace-- 'Tis the coming, dawning hour. Then the sword shall be the ploughshare, Birds shall mate in cannon's breast When all earth shall be at peace And shall find its longed-for rest; When the Sermon on the Mount From the hills of Galilee Shall sway the thoughts of men Throughout eternity. Personally I reckon that that poem near brought tears to the eyes of this wizened old man. How come we still keep on persecuting each other for differences in race, orientation and religion? And how many prophets are we going to kill and vilify before Stillwell's morning begins to dawn? When I talk about this achievement to my kids, I find they just don't understand the significance of achievements like this. I have to explain time over that there were no automobiles, and that people had to travel by wagon between Kansas City and Beaumont, Texas. It must have felt especially grand to the first time to settle down on a bench and let the loco do the work instead. And to arrive at your destination dust-free - albeit slightly deafened and smelling of the soot. I like to think that that is what made America's railroads so unique (until those Chinese fellows started muscling in that is). The rail companies were far more intimate, the chairman knew his drivers by their names, and their opinions - right down to where best to put the grasping handles - were listened and responded too. These days, of course, a railroad driver is little more than a computer operator, who uses a soldering iron, as opposed to a monkey wrench to fix minor "finger problems". Am I getting a little older? My partner certainly seems to think so, although he still doesn't appreciate my interest in rolling stock that takes me off on trips from time to time. "At least," he says "you go off on your own. I'd hate to see you fraternizing with a bunch of old farts." There's something about a mountain pass that I reckon brings out the best in train and driver. True, the days of a puffing billy heading backwards up the hill with slipping wheels are long gone. I still liken it though to being in a tug of war or Australian rugby scrum. Everything is working together for the greatest good. By that I mean the diesel motor, the generator or alternator, and those powerful electric motors nestling by the bogy wheels. I've almost given up trying to explain these things no non-believers, as I call non-railroad skeptics. It's as tough as trying to explain American baseball to a British soccer fan. To each his own, I reckon, or as the French say vive la difference . To me, being with a mighty loco at it stands idles gently at the top of Tennessee Pass is as good as any church. Plus you'll not find a non-believer there to distract you either. So I say God Bless America, and God Bless our Railway Pioneers who extended frontiers with these iron roads, no matter what the slings and arrows of fortune were that came their way. Arthur Edward Stilwell born 1859 had already made his pile when he decided to build another railroad. I'm not saying life was easy for him after that. Tennessee Pass is high up in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, where they rise10,424 feet above the oceans that are far across the distant plains.The Pass snakes across the continental divide north of Leadville through a gap between the northernmost end of the Sawatch Range (to the west) and the northern end of the Mosquito Range (to the east). In so doing, it straddles the headwaters of the Arkansas River (to the south) and the upper valley of the Eagle River - watershed of the Colorado River - to the north. These days U.S. Highway 24 follows alongside through the defile, allowing faster access between Leadville and Interstate 70 in the Eagle Valley. Of course in those days there was no road at all - except that is the one the navvies hacked out so they could carry materials up the mountainside. The pass has a deceptively gentle approach on both sides of the peak, with few steep gradients and no major switchbacks. In fact, the summit of the pass is almost level. The road across the pass is generally open all year round, and closes only during those severe winter storms that sweep down unexpectedly. These days, there's a recreation area up there too. It's in the San Isabel National Forest, called Ski Cooper , and operated by permit from the United States Forest Service. Most of the area is above the tree line, providing panoramic views of the Sawatch Range, and great skiing opportunities for visitors. During World War II it served as a training ground for United States Army troops of the 10th Mountain Division that hailed from nearby Camp Hale. You can still see a memorial to those of that division who died in defense of freedom in foreign lands, in a lonely spot at the summit of the pass. More spirits to listen too, if you linger there on a quiet day and let the sadness of their loved ones wash over you. The Denver & Rio Grande Railroad company constructed their narrow gauge railroad over Tennessee Pass in 1881. This formed part of their extension into the Aspen area, in order to beat the Colorado Midland standard gauge heading for the rich mining areas opening up. They followed up in 1890 with a new standard gauge line from Pueblo to Grand Junction, where they connected to the Colorado Midland Railway via a tunnel 200 ft below the summit. The modern version of the Tennessee Pass line followed on from the closing of the under-funded Colorado Midland route from Colorado Springs to Glenwood Springs. This happened at the time the United States Railroad Association had control of the line during the First World War . In 1945, the original Tennessee Pass Tunnel was replaced by a newer tunnel . In recent times, the Rio Grande Tennessee Pass line was still the highest mainline railroad mountain pass in the United States. After the Moffat Tunnel and Dotsero Cutoff were constructed, the line become a secondary route - with the the Moffat Route being Rio Grande's preferred crossing of the Front Range of the Rockies. This was mainly the consequence of the Moffat route having a maximum grade of 2%, as opposed to the 3% gradient on the west side of the Tennessee Pass. When the Rio Grande finally merged with Southern Pacific Railroad in 1988, the original Tennessee Pass route once again became the preferred Trans-Continental route. This was because it now linked to Southern Pacific's central route from California through to Kansas via Donner Pass, Tennessee Pass, and their trackage rights on the former MoPac route from Pueblo, Colorado to Kansas too. In 1996, Union Pacific Railroad bought out Southern Pacific and had plans to re-route all their trans-continental traffic over their own route through Wyoming. The Surface Transportation Board let the buyout take place, so two long-competing railroads were now in the hands of a monopoly called Union Pacific . As a result of this, their last train crossed the Tennessee Pass in 1997. At the present time, the line is not of much use at all to Union Pacific as the Mopac line to Pueblo, Colorado has been abandoned, and trains would have to travel from Denver, Colorado down to Pueblo, Colorado before they can head west over it instead. Notwithstanding this, facts are that the Moffat Tunnel can only accommodate around 25 trains a day - and has been operating at near capacity with increased coal loads out of Colorado. The route we visited in this blog be of more use to BNSF which currently has trackage rights over the Moffat Route (they currently operate a number of trains from the Provo, Utah area to Pueblo, Colorado and beyond to Mexico and Texas). In 2007 (as I believe I mentioned earlier) the Union Pacific Railroad did run a ballast train onto the disused section of the line near Avon, Colorado. However apart from the odd hi-rail inspection of parts of the line ,there is still no sign of a re-opening of the Tennessee Pass line as a through-route. And this brings me to the end of my tale. Overall I think it's a happy one because my Tennessee Tunnel route enjoyed it's place in history, and the way railroad ownership morphs will have another round some day. In the meantime I'm content to wander freely over it as I wave to passing, slower trains, taking in the scenery and soaking up the pleasures of the past.
