Perhaps ask friends and family if they think you have the voice for it, or record yourself and listen to it yourself. Any minor issues you can train yourself to remove from your voice perhaps.

Volunteering at hospital or student radio stations. You'll get a lot of experience, not just in being a radio DJ but also in the running of a radio station, and what to do when things go wrong. Remember to tape your shows, listening back to them will help you improve your performance, and it's also a valuable asset to have when applying for jobs. Potential employers can listen to the show for themselves. A radio DJ needs to know how to stay in control in any situation live on the radio. From an equipment malfunction to a troublesome guest. Any work experience you can get at a commercial radio station you should grab with both hands. S ometimes it can lead to a permanent position, but it will also put you in good stead if you later apply for a job with that station if they know you already. Make a good impression during your work experience and it may well be remembered. Remember, it's not all about being charismatic on the airwaves. Having a friendly manner with the other staff, being professional and being punctual are all important qualities for a radio DJ. If you prove you have these skills during work experience, it will put you at an advantage to other applicants whom the employers have never met. Most work experience jobs at a radio station won't be broadcasting, you'll be running about doing errands and making the tea most likely, but you can observe and learn, and it's a chance to show them that you are committed, efficient and a quick learner, so do your best if you get this type of opportunity. You will need to think about what would happen if you were ill and could not work. If you let someone down and they had to have their wedding reception without a DJ or any music, then you can be sure that you won't be getting any repeat business from them. They're also likely to tell their friends and family not to hire you. This type of incident can really ruin your reputation. Perhaps you could contact other mobile DJs in the area and have a plan of action whereby if any of you are ill or in some some sort of accident, you can ring around each other and find someone to cover your job. This could be very beneficial for all of you. You could also help each other out with equipment emergencies too. You'll also need to ensure you have a varied enough selection of music to be able to cater to all tastes. You're also likely to get requests, so a good range of music will stop you having to tell people that you don't have their favourite song. If you have a large collection of a particular genre of music, perhaps due to your own personal interests, then you could consider specialising. It's good to have a unique selling point. You may be the only DJ in your town that is an expert on country music for example. You could also consider other extra services that you could offer such as running party games, or organising karaoke. You could offer a light and laser show that's a cut above that offered by other mobile DJs. It's these extras that will make your services look more exciting than others and get you the jobs initially. Eventually you'll be able to build up your reputation and hopefully get lots of work via work of mouth recommendations. When applying for entry level jobs at radio stations, bear in mind that the smaller the station is, the more likely you'll be able to broadcast on air yourself. The bigger the station, the harder it will be to move up within the station. Gain experience with a smaller community station and then use this to apply for other jobs with larger stations. Do you dream of becoming a Club DJ? It's a common dream for many young people today, but that doesn't mean it's unattainable. There's a lot to learn to be a DJ. You'll need to know about all the equipment, and about the technical aspects of music, pitch and tempo. The best way to learn is to watch other DJs. If you can find an experienced DJ to mentor you, then this would be ideal. Offer help with carrying their gear in exchange for some advice and you could find that you are able to learn an awful lot. Remember too that being a Club DJ isn't all about having fun and partying. You're not likely to make a living being a Club DJ at first, so you may well have to work nights as a DJ then get up early to do your day job. Nightclubs aren't necessarily as much fun when you're sober, you're having to work, and have to get up early the next morning. You may also have to take into consideration your family if you are working late nights. One of the most important aspects of becoming a good DJ is practice, so having a room in your home set up is a great idea. You'll also need plenty of time on your hands, and a lot of energy too. You should think carefully about whether or not you want to become a DJ before you buy the equipment as it is very expensive for proper professional gear. If you can try out the equipment of a friend then do so. See how you take to it. Ask your friend if they think you've got what it takes. If you have a career as a DJ you'll need many other skills too. Many DJs are self employed so you may need to promote your business, advertise and do your own book-keeping. You may need to carry a lot of heavy equipment about and spend time setting it up and dismantling it. You may well need to learn how to fix and maintain this equipment too, especially in a hurry. You can't have an equipment failure five minutes before a wedding reception disco is about to start! If someone tells you your two minute report on the local fete now has to be five minutes long you need to be able to do this without pauses. If someone tells you you need to wrap up your report when you're only halfway through, you need to be able to do this seamlessly too.
