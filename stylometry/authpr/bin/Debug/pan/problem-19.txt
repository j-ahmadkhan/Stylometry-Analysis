For those who arerelocating or moving from dialup to broadband internet access,choosing a broadband ISP can cause some headaches. Should you gowith DSL or cable internet access? Which ISP is better? You mayneed to spend hours or days visiting individual ISP sites, readingdetailed service plans, checking for service availability in yourarea. Here are some simple tips to help you choose a goodISP. The first thing you need to find out is serviceavailability. In the past, you might have to go to the websites ofdifferent ISPs and scan for service availability for yourgeographical area. This is no longer necessary as some broadbandservice resellers have installed sophisticated software technology.This technology allows you to compare and choose from dozens ofnational ISPs simply by entering your phone number or homeaddress. What about price? Should you pick the one withthe lowest price? Before you can make an objective comparison, askyourself: what do you do most over the internet? If you like to play real time online games or youneed to download video clips, music files, games and softwarefrequently, connection speed should be your primary concern. Ingeneral, ISP and service plans offering higher connection speedalso cost more. For a family with more than one PC at home, theability to set up home networking is important. If you have a largefamily, you may want to choose a plan offering multiple emailaccounts. However, this is less important these days as free emailaccounts can be obtained from other sources such as Yahoo andGoogle. For family with children, parental control is auseful feature. You can also compare the entertainment pack whichcomes with high speed internet access. Almost all broadbandISPs provide free virus protection, pop-upblockers and anti-spam software. However, high speed internetaccess is often connected via a static IP address which makes yourcomputer vulnerable to hacker attacks. You should also install agood personal firewall program yourself. Read the terms and conditions of servicecarefully. Do you need to sign a one-year contract? Does the ISPprovide money back guarantee? You may be charged a penalty fee ifyou cancel the service before the contract ends. It is alsoimportant to check if the ISP provides good customer service and24/7 technical support. You can ask your friends which ISP they currentlyuse. However, please bear in mind that internet connection speed isaffected by many factors. For examples, DSL internet speed isaffected by the distance from ISP service center and the speed ofcable internet is affected by the number of people sharing thebandwidth in your neighborhood. Therefore, people from differentlocations may experience different connection speeds using the sameISP. Usually, you will get a better idea of actual performance bygetting feedback from your neighbors than friends living in otherareas. To sum things up, although price is an importantfactor in choosing an ISP, you should also consider your personalneed, family structure, features and terms of the service plan, andthe reputation of the internet service provider. Using comparisontools provided by some broadband service resellers can also saveyou time and money in the selection process.

Cheap ISP providers arean alternative to free ISPs because they offer much betterreliability, speed, support, and quality. Most free ISPs limit youto as little as 10 hours of internet access per month, which isn'tenough for most users. They also have annoying ad bars that wastescreen space, and they typically do not offer support for featuressuch as newsgroups. They also do not support computers other thanWindows. They also generally charge for technical support. Ingeneral, cheap ISP providers do not have those same limitations.Instead they are generally like other paid ISPs such as Earthlinkor AOL, except at a much lower price.
