reminded friends that Obama's passage to power had kicked off on the steps of the Springfield, Illinois old Capitol building the previous year. At the time many of these believed that the young African-American had the best chance of unseating the old order.

The Old State Capitol where Obama officially launched his campaign to become the 44th President of America stands on the same spot in Springfield where it was built in 1839. I mention this because the Americans are a restless people and have a habit of moving things around. It was the center of Illinois State Government through to 1876 when the larger State House replaced it. Abe Lincoln (for this was also his early stamping ground) frequented the law library before he debated cases in the Supreme Court. His most famous oration was his "House Divided" speech in which he said that a nation divided against itself will fail. After his death, America's most famous son lay in state there so that all could come and pay their last respects.

When his journey to the White House began last year on the steps of the old capitol in Springfield, Illinois where Lincoln's ended, Eric Sing endorsed an African-American candidate who was running against the entrenched interests of the Democratic Party and against all other odds too. He went on to capture Iowa and beat Senator Hillary Clinton in the most grueling primary that any could recall, even though the result seemed to close to mention. "I continue to support Barack Obama less than a week from election day, where I believe history is in the making," he concluded. A colleague sitting next to him and sucking thoughtfully on his pipe agreed. "We are dealing with the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, " he began. "Moreover,' he continued, we are caught up with an illegal occupation of an independent foreign country and a half-neglected war against terrorists in Afghanistan.

Let's not forget the Afghans sent the British Empire and the Soviets packing. President Bill Clinton bequeathed a booming economy and a budget surplus. All that George Bush will be remembered for is ten trillion dollars in deficit, and an economy on the verge of a terrifying recession. "John McCain offers the same dismal trickle-down economic future thanks to de-regulatory ideas that are little change from the deluded policies of George Bush . To add insult to injury he's suggesting even more wealthy tax-breaks, while abandoning our middle class to their own devices. What's more, John McCain has in mind to tax our health care benefits, cut Medicare and Medicaid benefits and demolish what's left of our hopes for universal health care." "I couldn't agree with you more," Eric Sung said to his old pipe-smoking friend. "What's more, he wants to privatize social security in midst of an imploding market, and risk our fortunes on uncertainty."

An elderly gent sitting hitherto in a quiet corner chimed in. "He doesn't even want out of an illicit Afghan war that's clocking up ten billion dollars every month. Poor American taxpayers!! In fact, the Republican candidate seems more in favor of cold war tactics where stubbornness, silence and the threat of violence defines our national politics - rather than openness and a willingness to engage our enemies. "John McCain claims to speak for justice and equality, yet he has consistently opposed the feminine right to choose, and is anti affirmative-action strategies.

John McCain may portray himself as a reformed maverick and a reformer. Let's not forget that he voted consistently with President Bush, and has backed away from every reform that he once championed." "I agree," Eric Sung said summing up. "Obama is our man.

John McCain can never become the solution for the future of America. In fact, he's but the self-fulfilling prophecy of a failed administration." "Of course (Eric Sung continued on that memorable day) I and my many friends view things differently, because we stand for the cause of freedom of all Americans, including Hispanics, Afro-Americans and the rest of them. The miracle Obama stands for is the possibility of moving on from the failed policies of Republican short-sightedness. Instead of arguing for war and robbing to poor to pay for it, he wants universally accessible health care for every, single American instead. And that regardless of creed, skin-color, existing health issues and so on. Excitingly, he's planned to pay for this by cutting tax-breaks for wealthy Americans who have no need for them at all. "Every time I page over a newspaper or switch to another news channel it seems to me that the tide of Obama support is growing exponentially.

" He wants to re-establish regulations and protective measures to ensure that a future melt down will not be as dramatic and devastating ," I heard one excited editor enthuse. Another mentions that " he has a clear objective in Afghanistan to apprehend and eliminate the terrorist there, and an exit strategy - agreed to by Iraqi for exiting Iraq responsibly when the job is done ."

Kansas, as you may already know is popularly described as exuding the enduring image of fields of grain waving in the wind. It's elevation rises three-thousand feet between the eastern and the western sides, although the transition is so gradual that it's almost imperceptible. Indeed, a flat-earther might be happiest here, for from some vantages the flat fields extend outwards acre after acre as level and as infinite as an ocean might be on a peaceful day. The wealthiest (and arguably the healthiest) were ranchers when Barack Obama was born.

The poor folk stayed in places like Wichita County.
