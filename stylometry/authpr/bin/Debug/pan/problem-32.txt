Preamble Arizona's "Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy" (CWCS) was accepted by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's National Acceptance Advisory Team in April 2006. The CWCS is the culmination of a 2-year effort during which Arizona Game and Fish Department solicited input from numerous experts, resource professionals, federal and state agencies, sportsmen groups, conservation organizations, Native American tribes, recreational groups, local governments, and private citizens and integrated those ideas and concerns into a single, comprehensive vision for managing Arizona's fish, wildlife, and wildlife habitats over the next ten years. More Background For over a decade, a coalition of more than 3,000 conservation organizations known as "Teaming With Wildlife" has labored to keep species from becoming endangered by increasing state and federal funding for wildlife conservation. This effort culminated in 2001 when federal legislation established a new State Wildlife Grant (SWG) program. SWG funds are used to support the needs of wildlife, their habitats, and related recreational and educational activities. In order to continue receiving SWG funds, each of the 56 U.S. states and territories were required, by congress, to submit a CWCS plan for approval to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Guidelines for developing the state plans and the 8 required elements were established by state fish and wildlife agencies working with the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the Teaming With Wildlife Committee. Arizona's CWCS is unlike existing recovery plans and other regulatory documents in that it builds on and complements existing plans and wildlife conservation projects that are already underway. The plan outlines strategies and conservation actions aimed at promoting partnerships and coordinating efforts among all who hold a stake in conserving Arizona's wildlife. As such, the plan addresses the full array of wildlife and habitats but focuses on identifying and managing the "wildlife and biotic communities of greatest conservation need". Arizona Predator Callers! We describe ourselves as a sportsman's club dedicated to the legal and ethical pursuit of wildlife predators throughout the state of Arizona. We attract hunters, and involve them in educational seminars and conservation projects in conjunction with the Arizona Game & Fish Department. We aim to provide several club hunts during the season as well as year-around. Imagine experiencing the starlit serenity of a quiet night in wild country, when, without warning the darkness is pierced by a frantic, plaintive squalling. You're probably hearing the final protests of a rabbit locked in the talons of an owl or clamped firmly in the jaws of a hungry coyote. Or is it? You could also be hearing a fake cry from one of our members - we are after all a "Callers club"! It all started back in the 1950s, and really took off in the following decade. Originally under the umbrella of the Arizona Varmint Callers Association, which sponsored interstate calling contests, many affiliated groups were formed, among them ours, the ARIZONA PREDATOR CALLERS. Founded in the mid-60s as the Mesa Varmint Callers (MVC), the club thrived and grew from a small affinity group into an institution among Arizona conservation organizations. The club changed its name to the ARIZONA PREDATOR CALLERS (APC) in 1995. Ironically, predator calling is not a group sport, in fact it's quite a solitary experience in most cases. There are occasions when two or three will prowl together. Some people probably regard our pursuits as a somewhat peculiar hobby, you know, the kind of thing you might expect from kids fooling about. But club members have always thought of themselves as hunters as well as conservationists, and, combining these two attributes, they're really very effective when it comes to communicating, cross-training, and educating the public. They also provide a unified voice in wildlife management and regulatory affairs - how strong is that? Friendly competition enhances enjoyment of most sports, hunting not least among them. Members of the ARIZONA PREDATOR CALLERS compete with other clubs in annual events and among themselves for the "Caller of the Year" award, based on points awarded for having called various species of predators, and for the categorical rank of "Master Caller", awarded to any member who calls all five of Arizona's common predators: fox, coyote, bobcat, bear and mountain lion. This feat was achieved by a club member only once in the past decade. During the 1960s, the club started a big-game trophy scoring and awards program known as the Arizona Big Ten Award , acknowledging hunters' annual and lifetime successes in hunting all of Arizona's big-game species. Adopted by the Arizona Wildlife Federation, the program spawned the first state-specific big-game trophy scoring and awards program and the first state record book, titled: Arizona Wildlife Trophies. Together with teaching its members the ways and techniques of calling predators, APC has been a leader in public education about a variety of species, hunting techniques and management issues. Refining its presentations in a series of increasingly large-scale and diverse seminars during the 1980s, the club educated thousands of hunters with programs on deer, turkey, elk, bear, mountain lion and javelina, typically pairing an Arizona Game & Fish Department biologist with an expert hunter to teach ethical and effective hunting techniques, coupled with a grounding in species' behavior and management considerations. The AG&F Game Branch Chief, Tice Supplee, often a speaker at these seminars, has commended them as "a very positive program". The early Mesa Varmint Callers was one of the many spark plugs supporting the AG&F Department's hunter education program. MVC ran one of the largest and most successful hunter safety - then called "Firearms Safety" - training programs in the state, in close cooperation with the Mesa Public Schools. APC assisted the AG&F Department's Information and Education Division, which was under-equipped with suitable projectors for the slide shows that frequently are part of the departments presentations. APC solved part of the problem by donating a powerful projector, since used to educate hundreds of hunters and wildlife aficionados. When some members complained that the Mesa Public Library had too little in the way of hunting-related material available, especially for use by youngsters, a club book drive produced stacks of books for young hunters to enjoy and learn from. It proved very popular too. The club's participation in a broad variety of conservation activities has not gone unrecognized. Granted the Arizona Wildlife Federation's "Prescott Award" for excellence in 1986, the club went on to achieve the prestigious "Chairman's Award" from the National Wildlife Federation, acknowledging the group's conservation contributions. Members are continually working on a variety of activities, such as accomplishing habitat improvement projects with the Forest Service, producing an illustrated monthly newsletter, helping the Arizona Trappers Association with political issues or their annual fur auction and the club's many other peripheral involvement. Affiliations with the Arizona Wildlife Federation, the Wildlife Legislative Fund of America and various ad hoc state organizations have made APC a significant player in Arizona's wildlife affairs. Founded and operated outside the mainstream of general interest rod and gun clubs or special interest "single species" groups, ARIZONA PREDATOR CALLERS has nonetheless focused on a wide range of hunting and wildlife management issues, and has made a substantive contribution to public awareness of wildlife management concerns. APC has helped to make better conservationists of its members, in every context of the word. It was only 30 years ago that the bald eagle, our national symbol, was near to extinction. Shooting and environmental contamination, particularly from the pesticide DDT, led to widespread nest failure and death of adult birds, and this species seemed doomed to join the legendary Phoenix in mythology. With the banning of DDT, and the protection afforded under the Endangered Species Act, the bald eagle population has increased dramatically nationwide. In 1999, the bald eagle was proposed for delisting (meaning, removal from the federal Endangered Species List). Delisting takes time, because the species and its environment have to be properly assessed. It seems that within the next two years the bald eagle will be removed from the list of endangered wildlife. A success story of note and states such as South Dakota and Arizona will be proud to host this magnificent bird in numbers once again. Arizona's other eagle species is the golden eagle, which nests in buttes that overlook grasslands . Golden eagles are dark brown all over. They look similar to juvenile bald eagles, and the two can be easily confused. For too many years, the bald eagle was considered only an occasional visitor to Arizona, and was not known to nest in the state at all. Today, the bald eagle is a year-round resident in Arizona. Since the first nest was reported in 1994, there have been more than 40 nests located in the state. Nests are generally built in the largest tree in the area (generally a cottonwood) with a clear flight path to water. Most nests are along the major rivers, but an increasing number of nests are being constructed near ponds and other smaller water bodies. Additional unreported nests likely exist in the state. In the winter months, bald eagles congregate in areas where water remains ice-free and the food remains plentiful, often in the tail race areas, below the dams. Although they feed primarily on fish and wounded waterfowl, eagles are opportunistic feeders, and will scavenge on carcasses and other food as available. Stands of mature trees are very important for bald eagles in winter, as they spend much of the day perched in branches of large trees overhanging water waiting for an opportunity to feed. At night, especially in extreme weather, eagles roost communally in one or two large trees that provide some protection from the elements. Favorite night roost trees are often located within a large forested area that provides protection from severe cold and strong winter winds. Eagles are very sensitive to human disturbance, so winter roosting areas are often closed to the public.
