The Playstation 2 is the successor to the Sony PlayStation console. The PlayStation 2 was first released in Japan on 4th March 2000. Next it was launched in the United States on 26th October 2000. The European release followed on 24th November 200 and the Australian release date was 30th November 2000. The console was immediately popular, due in a great part to the popularity of the precursor, the PlayStation.

The console was regarded as 'cool' and more fitting for teens and adults than the rival Nintendo console that was considered to me more childish. The PlayStation 2 had a stylish minimalist design which appealed to the tastes of that era. A huge array of games were available for the PlayStation 2, some that were very easy to pick up and play such as Singstar, some that gave the player the freedom to do things that would be illegal in real life, such as stealing cars in the Grand Theft Auto series. The console was also backward compatible meaning that those with a library of PlayStation games would be able to continue to play them on their PlayStation 2. The games were also easily pirated which also encouraged more people to purchase the console.

More PlayStation 2s were sold than any other console of its generation. 630,552 consoles were sold during the first weekend it went on sale in Japan. The console has a 128 bit "Emotion Engine" CPU clocked at 294 MHz in the first versions, and 299 MHz in later versions. There is 32 MB of RDRAM. It is capable of displaying 75 million polygons per second through the "Graphics Synthesizer" clocked at 150 MHz.

However these figures assume ideal circumstances and these figures have been criticized for being unrealistic and do not reflect real-world performance. The true polygons per second figure with full textures and effects is more like 13 million. The console has two controller ports, and two slots for memory cards. There is an e xpansion bay, a port for a network adaptor, Hard Drive and m odem an Infrared remote control port and 2 USB 1.1 ports.

Another very stylish game was Okami. It had stunning artwork using papyrus texture and cell shading, and delightful characters from Japanese mythology. Not only did it look gorgeous with the unique Japanese style throught, it was also a lot of fun to play. It was a comical game with some funny side quests to complete. The main missions were engaging and rewarding. The game is single player, you play as Amaterasu the sun goddess who takes on the form of a white wolf for this game. You have a variety of mystical weapons to use and also a celestial brush. Using this brush turns the screen into a scroll, you draw symbols with the brush to make changes within the game such as switching between night and days, creating bombs, summoning winds or cutting boulders in half.

As you progress through the game you learn more symbols to use. The aim of the game is to remove a curse on Japan. You do this by helping people to believe in the gods and restoring beauty to the world. The game uses a , Okami rivals any current game on any system in terms of graphics. The only complaint about this game was that the save points were not frequent enough meaning you had to play for a long time before you could save, or you'd have to repeat much of what you'd already done if you had to turn off the console before you reached a save point.

America's Santa Monica Studios developed the game God of War for release in 2005. The title won seven awards at the 2006 Interactive Achievement Awards.The awards included Game of the Year, Console Game of the Year and the Outstanding Achievement award, so you can see it was highly thought of. God of War is rated 18. It is an action-adventure game based on ancient Greek mythology.

You play as a fierce Spartan warrior called Kratos whose aim is to destroy Ares, the God of war. Kratos progresses through the game starting with his double Blades of Chaos weapon and receiving various gifts from the gods along the way such as the Army of Hades which shocks everyone in the vicinity with Poseidon's Rage, Medusa's Gaze which turns enemies into stone . He uses these to kill creatures of legend such as minotaurs, centaurs, sirens, and gorgons . Each creature is a different challenge. The combat in this game doesn't get boring. You can also use several imaginative and occasionally comical finishing moves to kill your opponents.

These range from tearing creatures in half with your bare hands, to strangling them to death. The game combines gruesome gameplay and cinematic style production. There's a big emphasis on storytelling to get you really involved in the adventure.

Even after the launch of the PlayStation 3 and the XBox 360, the PlayStation 2 still remained popular and some software companies were releasing software for it still. One such title that proved popular was FIFA 09. This was the ninth FIFA game on the PlayStation 2 console. Of course the player rosters had been updated. New game modes were also added. The animation was greatly improved upon that of the previous version, the players looked more realistic on the pitch.

Players moved quicker and it was easier to perform tricks. The game featured four new skills to master. Great for more advanced play. The first touch control system was also present and still very useful. The difference between quick and bulky players became more apparent too. The q uicker players could move the ball faster, allowing them to edge past the defenders, and the bulkier players could now use that strength to hold off the smaller players, and even knock them to the ground!

With practice you could hold up play and shield the ball while your team mates catch up. An option to choose simplified controls was added which proved great for new and younger players, making the game more accessible. Another new addition with this title was the Be a Pro camera. This lets you see the action from a camera focussed on your own player. There is also a season mode that allowed you to make your own professional player.

Manager mode is also present in this version and is in an almost identical format. However it now features several friendly matches during pre-season. You can play in tournaments, exhibition matches and there's the Challenge mode too.

Many people were disappointed that there was no online play mode in the game.
