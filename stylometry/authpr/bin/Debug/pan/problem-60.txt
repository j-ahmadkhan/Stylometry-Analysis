Atari Inc. is now thename of a French-owned game software company. The original companyAtari was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, andpersonal computers, and its dominance in those areas made it themajor force in the computer entertainment industry in the early tomid 1980s. The brand has also been used at various times by AtariGames, a separate company split off in 1984. The name Atari comes from the ancient boardgame Go, where "atari" is a Japanese term that applies to moveswhich threaten to capture opponent's stones. It may be used duringpolite games as a courtesy to make one's opponent aware of thepotential threat.

It is similar to "check" in chess.

The basic layout of the2600 is fairly similar to most consoles and home computers of theera. The CPU was the MOS Technology 6507, a cut-down version of the6502, running at 1.19 MHz in the 2600. The 6507included fewer memory address pins 13 instead of 16 and no externalinterrupts to fit into a smaller 28-pin package. Smaller packagingwas, and still is, an important factor in overall system cost, andsince memory was very expensive at the time, the 6507's small 8 kBof maximum external memory space wasn't going to be used up anyway.In fact, memory was so expensive they couldn't imagine using upeven 4 kB, and when they got a deal on 24-pin connectors for thecartridge socket, they were only too happy to thereby limit thegames to 4K Later games got around this limitation with bankswitching. The console had only 128 bytes of RAM for runtimedata that included the call stack and the state of the game world.There was no frame buffer , as thenecessary RAM would have been too expensive. Instead the videodevice had two bitmapped sprites ,two one-line "missile" sprites, a one-pixel "ball," and a"playfield" that was drawn by writing a bit pattern for each lineinto a register just before the television scanned that line.

Aseach line was scanned, a game had to identify the non-spriteobjects that overlapped the next line, assemble the appropriate bitpatterns to draw for those objects, and write the pattern into theregister. In a telling reveal of its Pong heritage, by default, theright side of the screen was a duplicate of the left; to control itseparately, the software had to modify the patterns as the scanline was drawn. After the controller scanned the last active line,a more leisurely vertical blanking interval began, during which thegame could process input and update the positions and states ofobjects in the world.

Any mistake in timing produced visualartifacts, a problem programmers called racing the beam. The video hardware gave the 2600 a reputation as oneof the most complex machines in the world to program, but thoseprogrammers who understood it realized that such direct controlover the video picture was also a source of flexibility. Oneadvantage the 2600 had over more powerful competitors such as theColecoVision was that the 2600 had no protection against alteringsettings in mid-line. For example, although each sprite nominallyhad only one color, it was possible to color the rows differentlyby changing the sprite's color as it was drawn. If the two hardwaresprites were not enough for a game, a developer could share onesprite among several objects (as with the ghosts in Pac-Man) ordraw software sprites, which was only a little more difficult thandrawing a fixed playfield. Despite the hardware limitations, manyAtari 2600 games have a lot of action on the screen, creating anengaging experience.

Additionally, the 2600 supported several types ofinput devices (joysticks, paddles, keyboards, etc.) and third-partyperipherals, and many of these peripherals were interchangeablewith the MSX and several other Japanese systems. In some cases, itis possible to use the Atari joysticks with the Sega Master Systemand Mega Drive/Genesis, though functionality may be limited.However Master System and Genesis controllers work quite well onthe 2600. The Atari 2600 used different color palettesdepending on the television signal format used.[16] With the NTSCformat, a 128-color palette was available, while in PAL, only 104colors were available. Additionally, the SECAM palette consisted ofonly 8 colors.

Design of the 8-bit series ofmachines started at Atari Inc. as soon as the Atari 2600 games console was released in late1977. The engineering team from Atari Grass Valley Research Center(originally "Cyan Engineering")[2] felt that the 2600 would haveabout a three year lifespan before becoming obsolete. They started"blue sky" designs for a new console that would be ready to replaceit around 1980, three years after the 2600's introduction. Whatthey ended up with was essentially a "corrected" version of the2600, fixing its more obvious flaws.[3] The newer design would befaster than the 2600, have better graphics, and would include muchbetter sound hardware. Work on the chips for the new systemcontinued throughout 1978 and primarily focused on much-improvedvideo hardware known as the Color Television Interface Adapter, orCTIA. During this gestation the home computer era began inearnest in the form of the TRS-80, Commodore PET, and Apple II family what Byte Magazine would later dub the "1977Trinity".[4]

Ray Kassar, the then-new CEO of Atari from WarnerCommunications, wanted the new chips to be used in a home computerto challenge Apple. In order to adapt the machine to this role, itwould need to support character graphics, include some form ofexpansion for peripherals, and run the then-universal BASIC programming language . The need forcharacter graphics led to the introduction of the ANTIC, aco-processor that ran in concert with the CTIA to provide graphics.Like the earlier TIA of the 2600, the CTIA was designed to producesprites and nothing else. ANTIC was built to generate conventionalbitmap graphics and characters, providing a number of differentmodes with varying color support and resolution. ANTIC and CTIAworked in concert to produce the complete display. Management identified two sweet spots for the newcomputers, a low-end version known as Candy, and a higher-endmachine known as Colleen (named after two attractive Atarisecretaries).[5] The primary difference between the two models wasmarketing; Atari marketed Colleen as a computer, and Candy as agame machine (or hybrid game console). Colleen would include slotsfor RAM and ROM, a second 8 KBcartridge slot, monitor output and a full keyboard, while Candyused a plastic "membrane keyboard" and internal slots for memory(not user upgradable).

At the time, the Federal Communications Commission(FCC) mandated that signal leakage in the television frequencyrange had to be extremely low. As the Atari machines had TVcircuitry inside them, they were subject to this rule and needed tobe heavily shielded. Both the 400 and 800 were built around verystrong cast aluminum shields forming a partial Faraday cage, withthe various components screwed down onto the internal framework.This had the advantage of producing an extremely sturdy computer,although at the disadvantage of being expensive and complex. TheFCC ruling also made it difficult to have any sizable holes in thecase, which eliminated expansion slots or cards that communicatedwith the outside word via their own connectors. Instead, Ataridesigned the Serial Input/Output (SIO) computer bus , adaisy-chainable system that allowed multiple devices to connect tothe computer through a single shielded connector. Although the 800included internal slots, they were reserved for ROM and RAM memorymodules.

Atari ran into problems inthe early 1980s. Its home computer, video game console, and arcadedivisions operated independently of one another and rarelycooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in thegame console and home computer markets, Atari was never able tofollow on the success of the 2600. In 1982, Atari releaseddisappointing versions of two highly publicized games, Pac-Man andE.T., causing a pileup of unsold inventory and depressing prices.Also in 1982, Atari settled a court case with Activision,officially opening the 2600 to third-party development. The marketquickly became saturated, depressing prices further. In addition,in December 1982, Atari executives Ray Kassar and Dennis Groth wereinvestigated for insider trading (later found to be false).

LarryEmmons, employee No.3, retired in 1982. He was head of research anddevelopment of the small group of talented engineers in GrassValley, California. The Atari 5200 game console, released as anext-generation followup to the 2600, was based on the Atari 800computer (but was incompatible with Atari 800 game cartridges), andits sales never met the company's expectations. It is rumored thatin 1983, in response to a massive number of returned orders fromdistributors, Atari buried millions of unsold game cartridges (thebulk of them consisting of two titles--Pac_Man andE.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial) in a New Mexico desert landfill. HowardScott Warshaw, the programmer of E.T. and several other Atari 2600games, questions the accuracy of this urban legend.

In its prototype stage, theAtari 5200 was originally called the "Atari Video System X -Advanced Video Computer System", and was codenamed "Pam" after afemale employee at Atari Inc. It is also rumored that PAM actuallystood for "Personal Arcade Machine", as the majority of games forthe system ended up being arcade conversions. Actual working AtariVideo System X machines, whose hardware is 100% identical to theAtari 5200 do exist, but they are extremely rare. The initial 1982 release of the system featured fourcontroller ports, where nearly all other systems of the day hadonly two ports. The 5200 also featured a revolutionary newcontroller with an analog joystick, numeric keypad, two firebuttons on both sides of the controller and game function keys forStart, Pause, and Reset.

The 5200 also featured the innovation ofthe first automatic TV switchbox, allowing it to automaticallyswitch from regular TV viewing to the game system signal when thesystem was activated. Previous RF adapters required the user toslide a switch on the adapter by hand. This unique RF box was alsowhere the power supply connected in a unique dual power/televisionsignal setup similar to the RCA Studio II's.

A single cable comingout of the 5200 plugged into the switch box and was used for bothelectricity and the television signal. The 1983 revision of the Atari 5200 has twocontroller ports instead of four, and a change back to the moreconventional separate power supply and standard non-autoswitchingRF switch. It also has changes in the cartridge port address linesto allow for the Atari 2600 adapterreleased that year. While the adapter was only made to work on thetwo-port version, modifications can be made to the four-port tomake it line-compatible. in fact, towards the end of the four-portmodel's production run, there were a limited number of consolesproduced which included these modifications. These consoles can beidentified by an asterisk in their serial number.

The design of the analog joystick, which used a weakrubber boot rather than springs to provide centering, proved to beungainly and unreliable. They ultimately alienated many consumersand quickly became the Achilles' heel of the system due to theircombination of an overly complex mechanical design with a verylow-cost internal flex circuit system. The controllers did,however, include a pause button, a novelty at the time that wouldbecome standard on almost all future game systems. Various thirdparty replacement joysticks were also released. Atari Inc. released the Pro-Line Trak-Ballcontroller for the system, which was almost as large as the 5200itself. A paddle controller and an updated self-centering versionof the original controller were also in development, but never madeit to market. Although the Atari 5200's internal design wasextensively based on that of the 400/800 home computers, thedifferences were sufficient that games designed for one would notrun directly on the other. One of the most obvious was the 5200's lack of a keyboard .

However, there wereseveral other differences: The 400/800's 10 KB operating system was replaced with asimpler 2 KB BIOS, of which 1 KB is the built-in characterset. A number of important registers, such as those of the GTIA andPOKEY chips appear at different memory locations. The purpose of some registers changed slightly on the5200. The 5200's analog joysticks required different input handlingto the traditional digital joystick input on the 400/800. (However,the 5200 reassigned/rewired two of the 400/800's existing analogpaddle registers for each bi-directional analog joystickinput). Atari Corp.'s later XEGames System revisited the idea of a console based on the400/800 hardware. However, as this was essentially just a 65XEcomputer with a detachable keyboard, it was able to run most of thehome computer titles directly.

Still, Atari held aformidable position in the world video game market. They were thenumber one console maker in every market except Japan. That marketbelonged to Nintendo, who had released their first game console,the Famicom (known to the rest of the world as the NES) in 1983.The system took Japan by storm, and Nintendo began to look to othermarkets. They approached Atari and offered a licensing deal - Atariwould build and sell the system, paying Nintendo a royalty. Thedeal was in the works, and the two companies tentatively decided tosign the agreement at the 1983 Summer CES. Unfortunately, at thatsame show Coleco was showing their new Adam computer, and thedisplay unit was running Donkey Kong. But Atari owned the rights topublish Donkey Kong for computers. Atari CEO Ray Kassar had a fit,accusing Nintendo of double dealing with the Donkey Kong license.Nintendo in turn tore into Coleco.

In the coming month, Ray Kassarwas forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the Famicomdeal were forced to start over again from scratch. These problems were followed by the infamous videogame crash of 1983, which caused losses that totaled more than $500million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20 and the companybegan searching for a buyer for its troubled division.

As forNintendo, Atari could no longer afford the Famicom deal, andeventually Nintendo would be forced to go it alone. In July 1984, Warner sold the home computing andgame console divisions of Atari to Jack Tramiel, the recentlyousted founder of Atari competitor Commodore International, underthe name Atari Corp. for $240 million. Warner retained the arcadedivision, continuing it under the name Atari Games. Under Tramiel's ownership, Atari Corp. abandoned thegame console market to concentrate on aggressively priced homecomputers, releasing the 8-bit Atari XE series and the 16-bit AtariST line in 1985. Then, in 1986, Atari re-released the Atari 2600and released its previously cancelled Atari 7800 console. Atarirebounded, producing a $25 million profit that year. The Atari STline with the innovative GEM operating system proved moderatelysuccessful, ultimately selling more than 4 million units. It wasespecially popular among musicians, as it had built in MIDI ports.Still, its closest competitor in the marketplace, the Amiga,outsold it 1.5 to 1. Atari eventually released a line ofinexpensive IBM PC compatibles as well.

Atari also released Atari Lynx, a handheld consolewith color graphics, in 1989 to critical acclaim. However, ashortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwidefor the 1989 Christmas season and as a result, the Lynx lostmarketshare to Nintendo's Game Boy, which had only a black andwhite display but was widely available. Also in 1989, Atari Corp.sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegalmonopoly. As the fortunes of Atari's ST and PC compatiblecomputers faded, consoles and software again became the company'smain focus. In 1993, Atari released its last console, the Jaguar.After a period of initial success, it, too, failed to meetexpectations. Although it was more powerful than competing consolesfrom the likes of Sony and Sega in some ways, it was also moreexpensive and more difficult to program. Atari's competitorsoffered larger software libraries and advertised much moreheavily. By 1996, a series of successful lawsuits followed byprofitable investments had left Atari with millions of dollars inthe bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari withoutany products to sell.

In addition, Tramiel and his family wantedout. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. InJuly 1996, Atari merged with JTS Corporation, a short-lived makerof hard disk drives, and the Atari name largely disappeared fromthe market. Although the original Atari ceased to exist, a largeamount of underground development remains for Atari's game systemsand computers of the 1970s and 1980s, and much of the ClassicGaming Expo's attention, which has existed since 1997, focuses onAtari. In March 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets toHasbro Interactive for $5 million, less than a fifth of what WarnerCommunications had paid 22 years earlier.

This transactionprimarily involved the brand and intellectual property; thedevelopment headquarters and design teams during this time werebought by Midway. The brand name changed hands again in December2000 when French software publisher Infogrames took over HasbroInteractive. In October 2001, Infogrames announced that it was"reinventing" the Atari brand with the launch of three new games.On May 7, 2003, Infogrames officially changed its name to Atari,Inc.

Atari 2600 emulation isavailable for most major operating systems and is now veryaccurate. Despite the relative simplicity of the 2600 system, it isnot an easy system to emulate. While it does not require a lot ofcomputational power to emulate the 2600, it is hard to accuratelydo so.

For example, because of the lack of a frame buffer , 2600 emulators must not onlyemulate the console, but the television as well. Due to thelongevity of the system, many 2600 games used undocumentedfeatures, and even exploited bugs in the hardware to squeeze themost out of the system, doing things even the original designerswould deem impossible (a notable example is the starfield of thegame Cosmic Ark). It took some time for the emulator programmers tomature their software to properly emulate the undocumentedfeatures, bugs and quirks of the system.

The MESS emulator supports recording and playing backof Atari 2600 emulation sessions. The Home Action Replay Page[24](aka HARP) allows Atari 2600 users to archive their favorite playsessions of the Atari 2600 system and its games. Some well known Atari 2600 emulators today are: Stella - An open source, multiplatform emulator (Windows, Mac OS X,Linux, Dreamcast, Nintendo DS, Wii). z26 - Another open source, multiplatform customizable emulator(Windows, MS-DOS, Linux) PC Atari Emulator - Easy to use, very fast emulator (Windows,MS-DOS). Handles the Cosmic Ark starfield effect correctly. MESS - the multi system emulator that supports all old Atariconsole systems The Pocket VCS PPC Easy to use, very fast and emulator (WindowsCE).
