intro: how BR thought of it, no one thought ESPN would work (there were no 24-hour channels back then), what he did to get it off the ground, how long it took before it became obvious that his idea was a great one When Bill Rasmussen first entered the world of sports reporting, his prospects did not seem bright. He had no official education or training in journalism, and had drifted into sports reporting only after other jobs didn't work out. Few would have predicted that he would launch the venture that completely revolutionized not only sports journalism, but the whole world of sports entertainment. In fact, some would say that Bill Rasmussen's brain child, Entertainment Sports Programming Network, changed the world of sports itself. Yet little in Rasmussen's background or early career would have foreshadowed his success. What happened next is sometimes described as Scott's coming up with the idea for a sports TV cable network along with his father, and sometimes as Bill's coming up with the idea along with his son. It seems that more credence is given to its having been Bill's brain child, with contributing efforts from Scott. (In fact, there seems to have been some idea early on that it would focus mostly or wholly on the Hartford Whalers, though this idea is not often mentioned in retellings of the early history of ESPN. It seems that it may have been contributed by another early partner, one associated with the Whalers, who dropped out of the partnership when they ran into early funding problems.) Bill Rasmussen envisioned buying a few hours of cable time a night and filling it with coverage of Connecticut sports. Most of the investors who had initially been interested in Rasmussen's plan evaporated once they learned how it had changed in the scale and scope of its ambition. Rasmussen, however, persisted. Using nine thousand dollars of his own savings and another thirty thousand that he had borrowed from relatives, he continued to develop his idea. In order to get his network started, however - to buy the satellite transponder that it would require, as well as land on which to situate the transponder where it would have an unobstructed signal, along with other significant capital investments - Rasmussen needed real money. In vain he tried to convince his investors that there was an audience (and advertisers) who were interested in twenty-four-hour sports coverage. Although ESPN has had many owners since its 1979 launch, it has always kept the basic format that Rasmussen devised at the outset: twenty-four-hour coverage of sporting events, combined with a few sporting news shows that would give more in-depth coverage of sporting news and analysis. In fact, many credit ESPN with creating the sports analysis news show as we know it today. Getty Oil's investment just before ESPN was launched gave it a majority state in the network. in 1984, ABC made a deal with Getty Oil to purchase ESPN. ABC retained an eighty percent share, and sold the remainder to Nabisco. Nabisco later sold its shares to the Hearst Corporation, which still holds a twenty percent stake today. ABC, a few years later (in 1986), was acquired for $3.5 billion by Capital Cities Communications. In 1995, Capital Cities/ABC was purchased by the Walt Disney corporation for nineteen billion dollars, who acquired an eighty percent stake in ESPN at the time. ESPN has operated since 1996 as a Disney subsidiary, but is still technically a joint venture between Disney and Hearst. It is estimated to be worth "more than forty percent of Disney's entire value." flubbing one or more phrases each time he tries. The camera cuts to a room full of replacement anchors seated on a bench like relief pitchers in baseball, several of whom are engaged in various warm-up activities for anchoring such as pointing at the camera and saying "This is SportsCenter ." Back in the studio, Kenny Mayne's producer approaches him gently, saying, "Maybe it's just not your night, big guy." Kenny insists that he can do it and pleads with the producer to give him one more chance. In the end, the producer calls the "bullpen" and San Diego Padres closer Trevor Hoffman comes jogging out to take the anchor's chair, while Kenny Mayne throws his pencil down in disgust at being yanked from the game. Another famous spot shows the SportsCenter anchors talking to prospective new reporters as though they are new recruits to a fairly low-level, poorly-paid sports team, telling them that sometimes if their throats get sore from talking on camera, the network will pay for them to see a throat doctor. Connections with Professional Sports Franchises If SportsCenter was what helped give ESPN its tone, it was the network's close connections and, in some cases, exclusive agreements with professional and college sports teams and leagues that helped it build its claim to being the best source for sports coverage, analysis, and news anywhere. In conjunction with the USA Network, ESPN was one of the first cable-based broadcast partners for the National Basketball Association (NBA). Although its first agreement with the NBA lasted only two years, from 1982 to 1984, the agreement marked the network's first attempt to establish official relationships with major organizations in professional American sports. After 1984, however, the relationship between ESPN and the NBA ceased, and for the next eighteen years there was no partnership between the two. In 2002, ESPN secured a $2.4 billion contract to broadcast NBA games (by then it was part of the ABC network, and in so doing rekindled its earliest compact with American professional basketball. In 1983, ESPN made it first foray into broadcasting professional football. At that time, it had no connections with the National Football League (NFL), which was firmly the property of ABC at that time. It was, however, able to establish a partnership with the United States Football League, which had just been launched in an attempt to compete indirectly with the National Football League. Without the presence of a broadcast partner that had many hours to fill and that was new enough to the sports broadcasting world to be eager for professional partnerships, the USFL likely would not have received much air time and would probably have folded sooner. The fact that it was not able to take advantage of the boost offered them by this piece of timely good fortune suggests that mismanagement was in fact rife at the USFL and was the reason it failed. Only four years later, in 1987, ESPN was able to establish an agreement with the National Football League that gave it partial rights to broadcast NFL games. The NFL agreed to the deal on the condition that ESPN promised to simulcast the games on local television stations in participating markets. This was an important condition in 1987, when the majority of television watchers still watched only free broadcast television and being a cable subscriber was still relatively uncommon. It was one thing for a fringe league such as USFL to be available for viewing only on a cable channel, but the idea of having NFL games available only to paying cable subscribers was at that time unthinkable. Criticism of ESPN As is inevitable when a network gets as close to the sources and subjects of its news as ESPN does, the network has had to endure criticism, some of it harsh, of the way int which it has covered specific sports. Its coverage of Major League Baseball came in for some particular criticism, especially in the following areas: Barry Bonds. ESPN has also come in for significant criticism over its coverage and treatment of NASCAR. This is an important issue for ESPN, because NASCAR fans are often made to feel that their sport is not a "real" sport. The criticisms leveled at ESPN over its NASCAR coverage touch on this issue. Many readers and posters on forums and blogs such as The Daly Planet (a popular NASCAR site) complained of excessive commercials during coverage of NASCAR events, as well as bored-sounding announcers, abuse of production technology, and perhaps most damaging, language that seemed to patronize or talk down to them. In 2008, ESPN made many changes in its NASCAR coverage in response to these criticisms. Its most significant change was its replacement of all on-air personalities who had not NASCAR backbround with ones who did. NASCAR fans also had complaints about numerous pre-emptions and relocations of coverage. A few of the more egregious examples include: - On August 18, 2007, the Carfax 250 event was shown ultimately on three different networks. The NASCAR Countdown before the start of the event was on ESPN Classic, the invocation and the national anthem on ESPN, and the race itself was moved to ESPN2 just before the green flag went down. Were these relocations due to major sporting events that had to be accommodated? No - they were to accommodate coverage of the the Little League World Series and a Scrabble tournament. - On September 30, 2007, there was a race called the LifeLock 400 that aired on ESPN. Due to a rain delay, it went past the end of the predetermined broadcast window (6:00 p.m.). Fox and NBC typically stayed on the original station airing the race even if it went long past the expected time; ESPN moved the race to ESPN2. - On August 4, 2007, the Food City 250 NBS Race, held at the Bristol Motor Speedway, was televised on ESPN2 - or most of it was. At some point in the race, a satellite uplink path was eliminated, which meant that the network headquarters' master control was unable to re-transmit the broadcast to cable and satellite providers. Instead, race fans saw a blank screen, then an ESPN2-logo "screensaver" - then the network went to commercials. By the time the error was fixed, the race was over, and fans had missed the final five laps.
