Diabetes affects almost 24 million Americans and people may be at risk and not know it With proper care from your diabetes team and yourself, this disease, unlike many other diseases, may be managed and complications can be reduced, delayed or even prevented.People living with diabetes may require daily insulin therapy depending on the type of diabetes a person has and how well his body can able to process insulin. There are different kinds of insulin , but all serve the same basic purpose. Insulin may be rapid-acting, short acting, intermediate, long-acting, or pre-mixed. Which insulin is taken is determined by factors such as: how the individual patient's body reacts to insulin how quickly the reaction is, the frequency and ability to take multiple injections age, target glucose levels lifestyle and activity. Only a doctor can determine the right insulin to take, and adjustments are likely to be made to achieve maximum benefits. Insulin dosing schedules will vary similarly, and are also dependent upon the type of insulin being taken. More than half those living with diabetes can eventually expect to experience neuropathy, a tingling sensation (or lack of any feeling) in the extremities brought on by insufficient blood flow. In severe cases, especially when coupled with untreated ulceration, bone infection can occur and lead to the need for amputation. DIAGNOSING DIABETES The information provided in this article is intended to improve your general knowledge concerning diabetes and for educational purposes. The information in this article cannot substitute for professional medical advice, nor does it replace the medical judgment of a licensed healthcare professional. Diabetes is diagnosed when the fasting blood glucose level is greater than 126 mg/dl on two separate testing dates, or if the blood glucose level is over 200 mg/dl with the presence of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) symptoms. Also, some physicians will order an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to confirm a diabetes diagnosis. Having a sweet tooth isn't necessarily a precursor to diabetes. However, a sensible diet low in fat and refined sugar does provide resistance. According to Ruchi Mathur, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, "It's a matter of smaller portion sizes more than anything else. Some people go to extremes by avoiding starches, but it doesn't work that way." Instead, she recommends limiting simple carbohydrates such as sodas, breads, and pastas made from white flour and other highly processed foods. Most people dont realize that 1 slice of bread or 1/3 cup of cooked rice breaks down into 4 teaspoons over one tablespoon of sugar in the bloodstream. According to the American Diabetes Association, there are 12,000 to 24,000 cases of blindness are reported in diabetic patients ranging 20-74 years of age annualy, primarily due to damage to eye vessels by high blood glucose levels. However, with good blood sugar control, approximately 76% of eye damage can be prevented. Nephropathy, or kidney disease - is another complication of diabetes that is characterized by the presence of too much albumin (protein) in the urine. Unfortunately, this usually remains undetected until too much damage has occurred, possibly renal failure. However, elevated blood pressure and triglyceride levels are often early warning signs. Did You Know? About 73% of adults with diabetes have high blood pressure. Heart disease and stroke account for about 65% of deaths in people with diabetes. About 60% to 70% of people with diabetes have mild to severe forms of nervous system damage. More than 60% of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations occur in people with diabetes. Mexican Americans are almost twice as likely and non-Hispanic blacks are almost 50% as likely to develop diabetic retinopathy as non-Hispanic whites. In 2005, 46,739 people with diabetes began treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and in 2002, a total of 178,689 people were living on chronic dialysis or with a kidney transplant. With good blood sugar control people with diabetes can reduce damage to their kidneys by 35-56 percent. Diabetes is treated depends on varying factors: The type of diabetes a person is diagnosed with the progression of the disease prior to diagnosis accompanying complications will factor into the treatment equation early on. Living with diabetes is a matter of learning to control blood sugar levels through lifestyle and medication. The basics of diabetes treatment are the same for all patients once baseline sugar levels are determined and target sugar levels are in control. Two things are basic to treating type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes: 1) Maintaining a healthy diet and physical activity are key basic steps, and 2) Testing to monitor blood glucose levels, so adjustments can be made to diet and exercise when called for. Type 2 diabetes patients may take additional oral medications (with or without insulin) to help control blood glucose levels at target rates or they may control their blood sugar with meal planning and exercise only. People with diabetes require no more special diet than the average person who eats healthy. Advancements in the understanding of diabetes have revealed that while a healthy diet is vastly beneficial to people living with diabetes, there are no special diet foods required by diabetics. The difference in diet for a person with diabetes is creating a consistent diet routine, balancing fats, proteins, and carbohydrates in particular. Carbohydrates turn to sugar in the blood, so limiting carbohydrates and being aware of carbohydrate intake is essential to good diabetes control. Eat a variety of healthy foods including fruit, vegetables, meat and proteins (nuts, dairy, grains). Choose foods high in fiber. Limit intake of table sugars (it is no longer held that diabetics cannot have any sugar; rather, sugars must be moderated and factored into a healthy diet plan).
