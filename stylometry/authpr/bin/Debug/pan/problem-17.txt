SURVEY FINDINGS Our three super sleuths really enjoyed themselves it seems, and they came up with some interesting findings too. The first "common" point of concern was that whereas each Used car parts outlet called was super-keen to land the order whatever it took. However, when it came to delivery, things started to fall, and fall badly.

Virtually every agent promised that while they did not really have the part required in stock, they would be able to find it elsewhere at no extra charge. This smacked of collusion, which in its worst form can lead to price fixing, a very dangerous scenario. Starting with Agent Y, she pursued a driver's-side front headlight for her boyfriend's Mercedes C200 1997 model. The dealer - see Review Five above - clearly advertised that they had the item in stock, but when it came to picking the Order and producing the invoice, a different story emerged. This prompted Agent Y to try a novel approach and use the dealer's website to order the very same part. Guess what, it worked too! Back came the confirming email, and it said that upon receipt of payment the goods would be dispatched and would be with our good team member within 48 hours. Quite some claim then, when the stock did not actually exist.

The other conclusion that Agent Y reached was not really surprising at all. When she called Auto Huntington - see Review 2 - she was on the receiving end of much taunting about this not being a woman's job. In fact, so sexist was the male call center operator that it made "Y" see red. So, she coaxed a name out of the operator and immediately put down the phone and called back and asked to be put through to the business owner. Bad luck for her, because she ended up with the same operator who was now really going to have some fun!

More about that one later, if we have time and space. Our own research - see Review Seven - was very interesting indeed. Far from being an alternative source of supply line when it came to finding Used car parts, these folk just didn't seem to care one iota! We may as well have been talking to a brick wall, and then in Chinese! Agent X had more success it seems.

Perhaps it's because this guy is a real car enthusiast, so he knew the terminology and got the answers to all his questions too. X feels that if you get through to the right agency, you can go far. Maybe it was the luck of the draw, who knows, but X came up trumps with both of his surveys. Moreover, he not only found what he was looking for, but he managed to secure excellent prices too!

Well done X, perhaps you need to train the rest of us... As for agent Z, has anyone really seen him/her? If so, please be in contact.
