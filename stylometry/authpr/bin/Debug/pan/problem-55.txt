When the auditorium has filled to capacity, and the audience quietened down, there's a sense of communal thrill as the latest Inu-Yasha movi e bursts into life on the giant screen . There's no way that televisi on can even attempt to compete with such larger-tha n-life drama. For it's not just about the story (the audience will have researched that on the internet already). It's about the dramatic way in which it's told. (In case you're not sure about the precise definition of the wording I used , as "episode" is a serialized version of a story that's released periodically. A "short movie" is not the same, because the whole stor y rolls out in a single showing. A "longer movie", by contrast ru ns for an hour or more).

I'll be the first to admit that I was already something of a fan of the oriental Motohashi style of produ ction used in Japan's movies these days, so it didn't bother me, it was just something I hadn't expected. In fact, s eeing Sesshoumaru unfold in Motohashi's style was a humongous " WOW " moment on reflection for me. On the other ha nd, t his movie began rather slowly for me .

H owever , there were so many t hings that stood out that I still can't lay do wn my overall memor ies of the movie . I'll always remember that iconic scene under the cherry tree , especially when our hero told the heroine, " I need you, don't you understand that? " I was hunting for a download of it on Amazon the minute I finished hearing the song " More Than Words ," and for week as I listened repeatedly to it I dreamed Inu-Asha was singing it to me(but then I am a romantic old fool) .

V illains are never my favorites (that applies e specially to Takemaru) and neither are the action sequences ( Houraijima and Guren) noteworthy in that regard). On the other hand, the Inuyasha/Kagome interaction is my all-time favorite in thi s genre . Sure I have my gripes , mainly about Kikyou and Sesshoumaru particularly, since there were things like the "obligatory sit scene" and the "obligatory Miroku-Sango buttgrab" that kind of were a bit eye-rolling at the time. I suspected t hey were pretty much there just to make obligatory appearances and consume time, and I wish directors wouldn't do that just for the sake of using has-been s they already paid for . SPECIALLY COMMENDED I haven't seen the movie in English yet , but I can assure you that in the Japanese version Satsuki Yukino as Kagome completely blew me away. Producer Kappei Yamaguchi gets my nod as always.

A trip to Tokyo to view the latest Inu-Yash a extravaganza wo uld be unthinkable without a visit a small town that is less than one hour away from the Japanese capital and the spiritual home of the cartoon art. As one approaches it, t he streets are lined with souvenir and furniture shops on both sides of the road. Jewelry boxes, sculptured animals, mirrors made of precious wood, kitchen utensils like bowls and trays, rocking chairs, tables, stools, you name it, they either have it, or they will make it u p for you to order.There's no end of what can be branded with a teenage cartoon series! The little town itself is simpl icity itself, considering it is now the major InuYasha hub of the country. In fact, the Japanese have added a retro-fit by installing aspects of 14th Century Japan.

You'll not find giant centipedes and open wells though, for the locals have added a characteristically softer touch. Before carloads of tourists may ma k e their way to the souvenir shelves, first the daily stock of foodstuffs including coffee must be transported in caretas. These o x carts come in all sizes and are everywhere . Some are surprisingly large and are made of various types of wood, giving them a unique design. Others are smaller and brightly painted and may be admired in a garden or on a terrace. Miniatures are intended for use as small decorations to be put on shelves, wher e they look as good as the real ones. Many native Japanese from Tokyo buy their Inuyash a souvenirs here too, for they have the reputation of being well - made and of good quality throughout, as well as looking really handsome. The dragons especially seem to be really popular.

You can get them carved in cocobolo, r on r on and ironwood, t eak and even rosewoo d. However these are just a few examples of the materials yo u' ll see there.Other options include plastic, fiberglass, and (would you believe it) pure gold. You can visit wo o dworking factories where these delightful souvenirs are made. ( I f you like, you could also s hop for d inning tables , shelves of all different styles, sizes and shapes , and office desks, although few visitors can set aside the time that's needed.) A ll the tools needed for the craftsmanship are powered through the energy of the nearby river . What's more, the series of belts are interconnected and can easily be changed at will according to the size of the object desired. This is where you may find the perfect souvenir or gift, as some of the artifacts are pretty small and can be shipped on demand. Sukiyaki is easy to find and provides a pleasant day trip through the countryside, while staying in Tokyo on a business tr ip or holiday .

The Japanese teen institution Inu Yas h a is unfamiliar to the western psyche, perhaps because we are brought up to eschew the manifestations of the alternate spiritual world. I'm sometimes asked whether it would be possible to re-brand the idea for a western audience. I'm unsure about that But t here does seem to be a trend in that direction with Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings. Could this signal a return to greater spiritual awareness in the Western mind? Certainly we are restless until we find our salvation wh a tever that might be. So who knows where this development might lead?
