Transportation & Maps It's not the most thrilling part of planning a trip, but deciding on how best to get from the airport to your accommodations (and back again) is usually a detail worth researching. Here you'll find Amsterdam's airport ground transportation options and the pros and cons of each. By Train Pros Fastest option. Very economical option. No risk of heavy highway traffic during commute hours. Cons Inconvenient for those with large or many bags. You must still take a tram, bus or taxi to your destination from Centraal Station. Cost 2nd-class Single: € 3.80 2nd-class Round-trip: € 6.40 Direct trains to Amsterdam Centraal Station run every 10 to 15 minutes between about 6 and 12:30 a.m. (every hour during other times). The trip takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Buy tickets either at the ticket desk on the arrivals level or at the yellow machines (with euro coins or with a debit card that uses a "PIN" code). Trains leave from platforms 1, 2 or 3, one floor below. By Taxi Pros Convenience of door-to-door service. Trip to central Amsterdam can be as little as 20 minutes if it's not rush hour. Cons Most expensive option. Risk of sitting in heavy highway traffic at peak commute hours. Cost Anywhere from € 33 to € 40, depending on destination and route. You'll find plenty of private taxis for hire in the taxi line just outside the main entrance to the arrivals and train station level at Schiphol. Be sure to choose a taxi from this line, not from individuals walking around soliciting their services. There is no set flat rate, but the fare shouldn't be more than € 40. By Bus Pros Economical option. Can be more direct than train if you're staying near one of the bus stops. Cons Limited service on weekends. Cost Single journey: € 3.60. Bus 370 (direction of Amsterdam Marnixstraat) is a cheap transportation option little known to tourists. The bus leaves Schiphol about every 30 minutes between 5:40 a.m. and 11:40 p.m. from the stop just outside the main entrance to the arrivals and train station level. The bus only makes five stops, two of which are conveniently located near many hotels: Museumplein and Leidseplein. The journey takes about 30 minutes. You can use the public transportation multi-stamp ticket called a strippenkaart (purchase at a magazine kiosk inside) or pay the driver the fare in cash. By Schiphol Hotel Shuttle Pros Cheaper than a taxi for door-to-door service. Reservations for return trip to the airport. Cons If you're one of the last stops on the shared route, the journey could take up to an hour. Cost Single journey: € 13.50 (adults), € 6.25 (children) Round-trip: € 21 (adults), € 11.50 (children) The Schiphol Hotel Shuttle, run by Connexxion, offers service to more than 100 Amsterdam hotels. Buses run every 10 minutes between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. from platform A7, just outside the main entrance to the arrivals and train station level. Journey time varies based on stops. Buy tickets at a Connexxion desk inside, near arrivals area 1 or 4, or at your hotel. Be sure to ask your hotel first if they offer a complimentary airport shuttle. Public Transit: Take the quick and easy AirTrain. Consult the New York City Subway Map to determine the best connections to take to get to your destination. $2 subway fare (available 24 hours). If you return to JFK via subway, make sure to take the A train marked Far Rockaway or Rockaway Park, NOT Lefferts Blvd. For other public transit options, including suburban areas and the five boroughs, consult JFK Transportation Options or the MTA's Airport Service information. Taxis: $45 flat fare (plus tolls) to any Manhattan location. Taxis are available outside of every terminal and there is typically a taxi stand where you will be directed to a taxi. For destinations outside of Manhattan, consult the TLC Fare Guide. You may also want to familiarize yourself with the Taxi Rider's Bill of Rights. There is no additional charge for luggage and rates are based per car, not per passenger (up to four passengers). To return to JFK from Manhattan, taxis will charge you the metered rate, plus any applicable tolls. Car Services: Pre-arrange for a car service to meet you at the airport, or call one when your flight touches down. This is a great option if you want to avoid waiting in line for a taxi or if you have a group larger than four people and want to arrange for a van or limousine. Private Shuttles: Several companies offer shuttles to Manhattan, including: New York Airport Service Express Bus: Available from 6:30 a.m. - 11:10 p.m., these shuttles leave every 15-30 minutes. Fare is $13 ($15 if you want to be dropped off at your midtown hotel), but you can save by buying roundtrip tickets online, as they are $22 (you can also buy discounted one way tickets online). One free child under 12 is included in the fare. You can choose to disembark at Grand Central, Port Authority or Penn Station, in addition to hotels between 31st Street and 60th Street. The ride takes about an hour. Return schedules and more information are available on their website. Super Shuttle: Available 24 hours a day, this shuttle provides door to door service for your party. Fares are $15 - $19, depending on destination. No reservations are required to get from the airport to your destination, but they are required for your return trip to the airport. Consult their website or call 1-800-258-3826 for more information. Rental Cars: Consult this list of rental car companies serving JFK if you need to rent a car. I discourage visitors to New York City from renting cars, unless they're planning extensive travel outside of the major metropolitan area. Parking is both expensive and difficult to find, and you will find your money better spent on mass transit and taxis. For other transit options, including suburban areas, inter-airport transfers and the five boroughs, consult JFK Transportation Options.

We have to screen everyone, regardless of age (even babies), before they can go through the security checkpoint. We will not ask you to do anything that will separate you from your child or children . We specially train our Security Officers and they understand your concern for your children. They will approach your children gently and treat them with respect. If your child becomes uncomfortable or upset, security officers will consult you about the best way to relieve your child's concern. NEVER leave babies in an infant carrier while it goes through the X-ray machine. The Screening Process At the X-Ray All carry-on baggage, including children's bags and items, must go through the X-ray machine. Examples include: diaper bags, blankets, and toys. All child-related equipment that will fit through the X-ray machine must go through the X-ray machine. Examples include: strollers, umbrella-strollers, baby carriers, car and booster seats, backpacks, and baby slings. When you arrive at the checkpoint, collapse or fold your child-related equipment. Secure items that are in the pockets, baskets, or attached to the equipment and place it on the X-ray belt for inspection. Plastic bins are provided to deposit such items. If any of your child-related equipment does not fit through the X-ray machine, security officers will visually and physically inspect it. Ask a Security Officer for help gathering your bags and child-related equipment, if you need it. The Walk-Through Metal Detector If your child can walk without your assistance, we recommend that you and your child walk through the metal detector separately. If you are carrying your child through the metal detector and the alarm sounds, our Security Officer will have to additionally screen both you and your child. Remove babies and children from their strollers or infant carriers so that our Security Officers can screen them individually. You may not pass the child to another person behind you or in front of you during this process. Do not pass your child to our Security Officer to hold. Our Security Officer may ask for your help screening your child.
