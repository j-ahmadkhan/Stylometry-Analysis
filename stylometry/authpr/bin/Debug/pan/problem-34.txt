How to Play: The aim of Omaha Hi/Lo poker is to finish with the highest or lowest poker hand. The Buy-In When sitting down at your chosen table, you must buy-in a minimum amount of chips, which is equal to ten times the lower bet limit of the game. Let's say, on a $3/$6 table, the minimum buy-in is $30, and on a $10/$20 table, the minimum buy-in is $100. The Game There are 6 to 10 players plus a dealer that are seated around a table. Omaha High/Low poker is using a disc called a dealer button indicating where the cards are to be dealt. The two players to the left of the button place live bets called the small and big blinds, prior to the deal. It is referred to as blind because the players must pay the amount before they can see their cards. It's called live because it counts as part of any further bets in the first betting round. The game starts with 4 cards that are dealt facedown to each player. The action begins with a betting round starting with the player to the left of the blind bets continuing clockwise around the table. Players may bet, check, raise or fold in turn. The big blind has the privilege of having the last action, check or raise the bet. The three community cards called "The Flop" are then dealt up in the center of the table and another betting round takes place beginning with the player to the left of the dealer button. Then, another card is to be dealt face up followed by a round of betting. "The River" , which is the fifth and last card, is dealt face up, then the final round of betting takes place. The players who remain in the hand will then show their cards and the winning poker hand is where the pot be awarded. Players must form their best five-card poker hand from the only two of their four pocket cards and any three of five community cards. POKER TOURNAMENT TYPES Here are the different kinds of poker tournaments to choose from: 1. Elimination Poker Tournaments The most common type of poker tournament. This lets all the players have the same amount of chips. The play will simply continue until one player has accumulated all the chips. As players get eliminated, active players are asked to change seats into the fewer and fewer tables. Although the winner is supposed to accumulate all the chips, other players can still be rewarded because this game has a payout structure. 2, Rebuy Poker Tournaments Players who lose all their chips are allowed to rebuy more chips and continue playing the poker tournaments. Rebuy tournaments have players that play more aggressive in the early part of the poker tournament, because they don't face the chance get eliminated if they lose their chips. Rebuy poker tournaments often lead to a larger total prize that is being played for the standard initial entry cost. 3. Shootout tournaments The tables will not be reduced or combined as players get eliminated, instead the game will continue in each table until a single winner prevails. This tournament lasts for several hours, yet still less than elimination poker tournaments. Winners of each table will just face off in another table later on. For example, there are 10 poker tables. Later on, the 10 winners of each poker tables will meet head-on elimination style knocking out each other until there will be a winner at the finals table. Satellite Poker Tournaments- This kind of poker tournament is the preliminary or mini poker tournaments.
