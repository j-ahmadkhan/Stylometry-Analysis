The taxon Dinosauria was formallynamed by the English palaeontologist Richard Owen in 1842 as "adistinct tribe or suborder of Saurian reptiles". The term isderived from the Greek words ( deinos meaning "terrible","fearsome" or "formidable") and Ã± ( saura meaning "lizard" or"reptile"). Owen chose it to express his awe at the size andmajesty of the extinct animals, not out of fear or trepidation attheir size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth andclaws.Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals;according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identifiedwith certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to haveexisted.Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurswere bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon , could walkjust as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearlyall known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantlyterrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat. There is also a taxonomic definition, which says that dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recentcommon ancestor of Triceratops and modern birds. They are dividedinto Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped),depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had afour-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating acaudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) aforward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure ofsaurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bonedirected cranially, or forwards, only. Ornithischia includes alltaxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with Triceratops thanwith Saurischia, while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing amore recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. Ithas also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all thedescendants of the most recent common ancestor of Megalosaurus andIguanodon, because these were two of the three genera cited byRichard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria. A modern definition is the phylogenetic taxonomy. faunal stage ) to theLate Cretaceous (going extinct at the end of the Maastrichtian ). Many prehistoricanimals are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such asichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and Dimetrodon , but are notclassified scientifically as dinosaurs. Marine reptiles likeichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs were neither terrestrialnor archosaurs; pterosaurs were archosaurs but not terrestrial;and Dimetrodon was a Permian animal more closely related tomammals. Dinosaurs were thedominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially theJurassic and Cretaceous. Other groups of animals were restricted insize and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded the size ofa cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of smallprey. One notable exceptionis Repenomamusgiganticus , a triconodont weighingbetween 12 kilograms (26 lb) and 14 kilograms (31 lb) that is knownto have eaten small dinosaurs like young Psittacosaurus . Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group ofanimals; according to a 2006 study, over 500 dinosaur genera havebeen identified with certainty so far, and the total number ofgenera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around1,850, nearly 75% of which remain to bediscovered. An earlier study predictedthat about 3,400 dinosaur genera existed, including many whichwould not have been preserved in the fossilrecord. As ofSeptember 17, 2008, 1,047 different species of dinosaurs have beennamed. Some were herbivorous, otherscarnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds, andothers, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon , could walk just as easilyon two or four legs. Many had bony armor, or cranial modificationslike horns and crests. Although known for large size, manydinosaurs were human-sized or smaller. Dinosaur remains have beenfound on every continent on Earth, includingAntarctica. No dinosaurs areknown to have lived in marine or aerial habitats, although it ispossible some feathered theropods were flyers. Nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far sharecertain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton.Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modifiedversions of these traits, they are considered typical acrossDinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on toall their descendants. Such common features across a taxonomicgroup are called synapomorphies. Dinosaur synapomorphies include an elongatedcrest on the humerus, or upper arm bone, to accommodate theattachment of deltopectoral muscles; a shelf at the rear of theilium, or main hip bone; a tibia, or shin bone, featuring a broadlower edge and a flange pointing out and to the rear; and anascending projection on the astragalus, one of the ankle bones,which secures it to the tibia. A variety of otherskeletal features were shared by many dinosaurs. However, becausethey were either common to other groups of archosaurs or were notpresent in all early dinosaurs, these features are not consideredto be synapomorphies. For example, as diapsid reptiles, dinosaursancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members ofthe diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the snoutand lower jaw. Additionally,several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are nowknown to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in theearliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaurgroups. These include an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; asacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are foundin some other archosaurs, but only two are found in Herrerasaurus ); and an acetabulum, orhip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closedin Saturnalia ,for example). Another difficultyof determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that earlydinosaurs and other archosaurs from the Late Triassic are oftenpoorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals havesometimes been misidentified in the literature. herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, from the two majororders comprising all dinosaurs (ornithischia and saurischia) downto the more exclusive (but still very populous) infraorders likecarnosauria and sauropoda. Saurischian Dinosaurs Order: Saurischia The nameof this order means "lizard-hipped," and refers to dinosaurs with acharacteristic, lizard-like pelvic structure. Saurischians werealso distinguished by their long necks and asymmetricalfingers. Suborder: Theropoda These"beast-footed" dinosaurs included some of the most familiarpredators roaming the landscapes of the Jurassic and Cretaceouseras. Theropods never went extinct; today they're represented bythe vertebrate class "aves"--that is, birds. Infraorder: Herrerasauria The herrerasaurs comprise only fourdinosaurs, the most well-known of which are Staurikosaurus andHerrerasaurus. These dinosaurs are characterized by weirdanatomical traits, such as only two sacral vertebrae and a moreprimitive hand structure than later theropods (some paleontologistseven dispute whether herrerasaurs were dinosaurs at all!).Herrerasaurs became extinct at the end of the Triassic (208 millionyears ago), well before the better-known dinosaurs of the Jurassicand Cretaceous. Infraorder: Ceratosauria Unlike the case with the moreprimitive herrerasaurs, it's generally accepted that ceratosaurswere true dinosaurs. These creatures were characterized by theirhollow bones, S-shaped necks, and unique jaw structures, and arethe first dinosaurs to show any sort of resemblance to birds (whichevolved tens of millions of years later). The most well-knownceratosaurs are Ceratosaurus, Dilophososaurus and Coelophysis]. Infraorder: Coelurosauria Technically, what setscoelurosaurians apart from other dinosaurs is that they're moreclosely related to birds than to their sister infraorder, thecarnosauria (described below). One problem with thisclassification--the membership of which is far from set instone--is that it includes such a wide array of members, rangingfrom Velociraptor to Ornithomimus to T. Rex. Coelurosaurs aredistinguished by the structure of their sacrums, tibias and ulnas,among other skeletal features. Infraorder: Carnosauria You might expect an infraorder namedcarnosauria to include such terrifying meat-eaters as T. Rex, butthat isn't the case. Besides their carnivorous diet, carnosaurs aredistinguished by the comparative lengths of their femurs andtibias, the size of their eye sockets and the shapes of theirskulls, among other anatomical features. They also had fairly largefront arms, which is why T. Rex didn't make the cut. Examples ofcarnosaurs include Allosaurus and Spinosaurus. Infraorder: Therizinosauria This infraorder was once known assegnosauria, and it's hopped back and forth all over theevolutionary map: the latest trend is to consider therizinosaurs asclosely related to birds, hence their inclusion under theropods.These dinosaurs were characterized by their extremely long claws,backward-facing pubic bones (similar to birds), four-toed feet, and(mostly) large sizes. Not many dinosaurs are classified in thisinfraorder; the most prominent examples are Therizinosaurus andSegnosaurus. Suborder: Sauropodomorpha The description of this suborder pretty much matches that of theinfraorder sauropoda, described below. These four-footed,none-too-bright herbivorous dinosaurs often reached astonishingsizes. Infraorder: Prosauropoda As you might guess from their name,the prosauropods--small- to medium-sized herbivorous dinosaurs withlong necks and small heads--were once thought to be ancestral tobig, lumbering sauropods like Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus.However, paleontologists now believe that these Triassic- andJurassic-era dinosaurs may not have been the direct ancestors ofthe sauropods, but more like their "uncles." A good example of aprosauropod is Plateosaurus. Infraorder: Sauropoda Sauropods were the true giants of thedinosaur age, including such lumbering beasts as Diplodocus,Argentinosaurus and Apatosaurus. These four-legged, long-neckedherbivores were characterized by their erect limbs (similar tothose of modern elephants), relatively small heads with tinybrains, and placement of nostrils on the top rather than the frontof the skull. They were especially numerous toward the end of theJurassic period, though many species survived up to the K/TExtinction. There were larger dinosaurs, butknowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of incompletefossil samples. The largest herbivorous specimens on record wereall discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massiveArgentinosaurus, which may have weighed 80,000-100,000 kg (88-121tons); the longest, the 40 m (130 ft) long Supersaurus; and thetallest, the 18 m (60 ft) Sauroposeidon, which could have reached asixth-floor window. The largest known carnivorous dinosaur wasSpinosaurus, reaching a length of 16-18 meters (53-60 ft), andweighing in at 9 tons. Other large meat-eaters includedGiganotosaurus, Mapusaurus, Tyrannosaurus rex andCarcharodontosaurus. The first perceived direct evidenceof herding behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31 Iguanodondinosaurs which were thought to have perished together inBernissart, Belgium, after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkholeand drowned. Despite the deposition of those skeletons being nowregarded as more gradual, other, well supported, mass death siteswere subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways,suggest that herd or pack behavior was common in many dinosaurspecies. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivoresindicate that duck-bills (hadrosaurids) may have moved in greatherds, like the American Bison or the African Springbok. Sauropodtracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed ofseveral different species, at least in Oxford, England, and otherskept their young in the middle of the herd for defense according totrackways at Davenport Ranch, Texas. Dinosaurs may have congregatedin herds for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provideprotection for their young. Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generallybased on the pose of body fossils and their habitat, computersimulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modernanimals in similar ecological niches. As such, the currentunderstanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and willlikely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However,there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common incrocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, werealso common among dinosaurs. Jack Horner's 1978 discovery of a Maiasaura (thegood mother dinosaur) nesting ground in Montana demonstrated thatparental care continued long after birth among the ornithopods.There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, likethe Patagonian sauropod Saltasaurus (1997 discovery), had similarnesting behaviors, and that the animals congregated in huge nestingcolonies like those of penguins. The Mongolian maniraptoranOviraptor was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer offeathers that kept the eggs warm. Trackways have also confirmedparental behavior among sauropods and ornithopods from the Isle ofSkye in northwestern Scotland. Nests and eggs have been found formost major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely thatdinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar tomodern birds and crocodiles. The crests and frills of somedinosaurs, like the marginocephalians, theropods andlambeosaurines, may have been too fragile to be used for activedefense, so they were likely used for sexual or aggressivedisplays, though little is known about dinosaur mating andterritorialism. The nature of dinosaur communication also remainsenigmatic, and is an active area of research. For example, recentevidence suggests that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines mayhave functioned as resonance chambers used for a wide range ofvocalizations. From a behavioral standpoint, one of the mostvaluable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops, provingthat dinosaurs did indeed attack and eat each other. Whilecannibalistic behavior among theropods is no surprise, this too wasconfirmed by tooth marks from Madagascar in 2003. There seem to have been no burrowing species ofdinosaur and few climbing species. This is somewhat surprising whencompared to the later mammalian radiation in the Cenozoic, whichincluded many species of these types. As to how the animals moved,biomechanics has provided significant insight. For example, studiesof the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletalstructure have demonstrated how fast dinosaurs could run, whetherdiplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tailsnapping,whether giant theropods had to slow down when rushing forfood to avoid fatal injuries, and if sauropods couldfloat. Dinosaurs are believed to have gone extinct about 65million years ago, about 55 million years before the first humans appeared on Earth due to a meteor impact. Creationist scientists,however, reject the "Great Impact Theory" that a meteor struck theearth and caused climatic changes which caused the extinction ofdinosaurs and claim there are multiple problems evidentially withthis theory. In addition, creationist Michael Matthews quotes columnist John Leoas stating that one of the most frequent science headlines is "NewTheory of Dinosaur Extinction". Creationist Michael Matthews quotesJohn Leo as saying, "No matter how you think the tiresome giantreptiles died off, it always turns out that they probably perishedsome other way." Creationists assert that evolutionists arefrequently coming out with a "New Theory of Dinosaur Extinction"theories and that their theories are laden with falseassumptions. Most creationists believe that dinosaurs coexistedwith mankind on Earth and livedrecently. Creationist scientists believe that dinosaurs and mancoexisted which they claim is based on a number of pieces ofevidence. In fact, creationist theories regarding dinosaurextinction include this most relentless causes of animal extinction- mankind . Humans have a natural instinct to kill any animal that possessesa threatening imposition. Historically, reptiles of any significant size have beenautomatically and immediately killed when in the proximity of humanhabitats. Large reptiles the size of dinosaur would certainly beperceived as a threat and hunted-down by humans possessing huntingcapabilities. However, historical accounts of dinosaur-sized animals are being dismissed as mythological because these animalsare assumed to have gone extinct millions of years ago. We use"Dinosaur" in reference to a group of large reptilian-like animalspreviously labeled "dragon". Perhaps dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus survived the flood,but could not survive mankind. There is much evidence thatdinosaurs existed very recently and coexisted with mankind.Prehistoric cave paintings and carvings have been foundillustrating first-hand knowledge of these creatures by earlyhumans. Dinosaur tracks have been found alongside human tracks. Dinosaur bones have also been found that areunfossilized with soft tissues still present indicating recentburial. It should be considered probable that many modern reptiles aredistant relatives of larger varieties found in the fossil record.Although many dinosaurs are indeed extinct, it is certain that ifallowed to live as they did before the flood , modern reptilesmight reach much larger sizes and closely resemble their ancestorsfound in the fossil record. Furthermore, numerous people havereported seeing dinosaur-sized creatures. Dinosaurs in our culture Dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance andoften enormous size. As such, they have captured the publicimagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Onlythree decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaurremains, the famous dinosaur sculptures were erected in CrystalPalace Park in London. These sculptures excited the public sostrongly that smaller replicas were sold, one of the first examplesof tie-in merchandising. Since Crystal Palace, dinosaur exhibitionshave opened at parks and museums around the world, both cateringto, and reinforcing, the public interest. Dinosaur popularity haslong had a reciprocal effect on dinosaur science, as well. Thecompetition between museums for public attention led directly tothe Bone Wars waged between Marsh and Cope, each striving to returnwith more spectacular fossil remains than the other, and theresulting contribution to dinosaur science was enormous. Dinosaurshold an integral place in modern culture. The word "dinosaur"itself has entered the English lexicon as an expression describinganything that is impractically large, slow-moving, or obsolete,bound for extinction. The public preoccupation with dinosaurs ledto their inevitable entrance into worldwide popular culture.Beginning with a passing mention of Megalosaurus in the firstparagraph of Charles Dickens' Bleak House in 1852,[64] dinosaurshave been featured in a broad array of fictional works. Sir ArthurConan Doyle's 1912 book The Lost World, the iconic 1933 film KingKong, the 1954 introduction of Godzilla and its many subsequentsequels, the best-selling 1990 novel Jurassic Park by MichaelCrichton and its 1993 film version, briefly the highest-grossingfilm of all time, are just a few prominent examples of the longtradition of dinosaurs in fiction. Non-fiction authors, includingsome prominent paleontologists, have also sought to take advantageof dinosaur popularity, especially among children, to educatereaders about dinosaurs in particular and science in general.Dinosaurs are also ubiquitous in advertising, with numerouscompanies seeking to utilize dinosaurs to sell their own productsor to characterize their rivals as slow-moving orobsolete.
