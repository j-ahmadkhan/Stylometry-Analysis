What is an arrhythmia? Normal heart beat is a regular, consistent and coordinated rhythm, speeding up or slowing down in response to physical activity or to an emotional event. This regular rhythmic pattern can be disrupted by various conditions causing the heart to beat either inappropriately slow or fast or in an uncoordinated manner. Any such irregular heartbeat is called an arrhythmia. Arrhythmias are very common, especially in older people, but it may occur in children or younger people. While some arrhythmias are harmless, others can be serious, leading to heart disease, stroke, or sudden cardiac death. Fortunately, most of these arrhythmias can be controlled with medicines, implantable devices such as pacemakers, or surgical procedures.

Sinus Bradycardia A sinus rate of < 60 beats/minute. Sinus bradycardia may be normal finding during sleep, in athletes it may be an indication of excellent physical conditioning; however, in the elderly, it often an indicates of sinus node disease. Inferior MI, hypothermia, myxedema, or increased intracranial pressure may cause this arrhythmia. For apparently healthy persons aged 40 to 80 with sinus rates < 50 beats/minute, 5-year cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates do not appear to be increased. Treatment is not needed unless symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion are present. If such symptoms are chronic, pacemaker implantation is the definitive treatment. Sinoatrial Block Inability of sinus node impulses to depolarize the atria.

Sinoatrial block is often 2:1, resulting in atrial and ventricular rates that are exactly one half the sinus rate. In the elderly, common causes are intrinsic conduction system disease, ischemia, digitalis toxicity, and toxicity from class Ia antiarrhythmics. The diagnosis is made when an ECG shows a pause in the sinus rhythm equal to a multiple of the underlying PR interval. Treatment is similar to that for sinus bradycardia.

There are three degrees of heart block. In first-degree heart block, impulses reach the ventricles but are slightly delayed more than normal as they travel through the AV node. This arrhythmia is common in young adults, athletes, and in those with a highly active vagus nerve (the tenth cranial nerve). First-degree heart block also occurs in people with rheumatic fever, sarcoidosis, and other structural heart problems, and in those taking certain medications, notably beta-blockers. This form of heart block does not cause symptoms. In second-degree heart block, some of the heart electrical impulses do not reach the ventricles. As a result, the heart beats slowly, irregularly, or both.

Second-degree heart block sometimes progresses to third-degree heart block. In third-degree, or complete, heart block, electrical impulses do not pass from the atria to the ventricles. This causes the heartbeat to slow. Secondary pacemaker cells in the ventricles take over, signaling the lower chambers of the heart to contract, but at a slower rate than normal. Third-degree heart block is usually caused by heart disease or medications.

It may also be present at birth (congenital heart block).

First-degree atrioventricular block: First-degree block may occur in healthy persons with high vagal tone, or it may be caused by intrinsic conduction system disease or by various drugs (eg, digoxin, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs). The PR interval is prolonged (>= 0.22 seconds). It does not significantly increases cardiac morbidity and mortality of patients, no treatment is required. Second-degree atrioventricular block: It may occur in three different patterns. In Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) block, the PR interval is progressively prolonged until a QRS complex is dropped.

Because this block is usually above the level of the His-Purkinje system, the QRS complex typically appears normal. Digitalis toxicity and acute inferior MI are common precipitating factors. Mobitz type I block is usually transient, resolves spontaneously and specific treatment is rarely needed. In Mobitz type II block, the PR interval is fixed, but QRS complexes are dropped resulting in dropped ventricular contraction. Because the conduction block occurs at or below the His bundle, the QRS complexes are often wide. Mobitz type II block is most commonly caused due to acute anterior MI, myocarditis, or advanced sclerodegenerative conduction system disease. Patients with this block are usually symptomatic and presents with complaints of syncope due to inadequate cerebral perfusion (Stokes-Adams attack). Because of the dangerous symptoms and frequent progression to complete heart block, treatment is usually needed and patients are implanted with a permanent pacemaker.

If the block is of high-grade, there may be a mathematical relationship between the P waves and QRS complexes such as 2:1, 3:1. High-grade block may progress to complete heart block. Patients are often symptomatic and usually treated by implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block: Impulses arising in atria cannot travel down to ventricles. V entricles cannot be activated by a trial depolarizations. If the block is within the AV node, QRS complexes are usually normal and an escape rate of almost 60 beats/minute. Common causes of third-degree AV block include acute inferior MI and digitalis toxicity.

This block is usually transient, and no specific treatment is not needed. If it is caused by digitalis toxicity, the drug is stopped. Temporary pacemakers may be needed when hypotension or symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion are present. If block is within the ventricles, it is accompanied by wide QRS complexes and a slow escape rate usually < 40 beats/minute. Such block may occur in patients with severe sclerodegenerative conduction system disease or extensive acute anterior MI. These patients usually respond poorly to medical treatment with atropine and isoproterenol, implantation of permanent pacemaker is usually necessary. Sick Sinus Syndrome or Sinus node dysfunction A variety of rhythm disturbances that reflect sinoatrial node dysfunction and are often associated with dysfunction elsewhere in the conduction system. Coronary artery disease and primary sclerodegenerative process are the most common precipitating factors, although it may be precipitated by many other heart diseases.

Patients may present with bradyarrhythmias (sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses or arrest, sinoatrial exit block, or atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response) or with the bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, in which a supraventricular tachycardia terminates in a long period of asystole. Thus patients present with combined symptoms of palpitations or chest pain during tachycardia and dizziness or syncope during bradycardia. The long-term prognosis for patients with sick sinus syndrome is primarily dependent on the presence and severity of the underlying heart disease. For tachycardia (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, or atrial fibrillation), digoxin, other antiarrhythmic drugs, or cardioversion is used. For bradycardia associated with syncope, a permanent pacemaker is needed.

Bundle branch block The hearts electrical impulses travel from the atria to the ventricles through the AV (atrioventricular) node. After the impulses go through the AV node, they travel along a track of fibers called the bundle of His, which divides into two parts, a right and left bundle, which connect, respectively, to the right and left ventricles. Normally, impulses travel down both bundles at the same speed, triggering the ventricles to contract simultaneously. Sometimes, a block occurs in one of the branches, forcing the impulses to take a detour, slowing them down. As a result, one part of the ventricle contracts later than the other.

Bundle branch block impairs the heart's ability to pump blood, making it work less efficiently. The condition itself often causes no symptoms and requires no direct treatment. However, it may be a sign of an underlying heart problem.

Causes of Bradyarrhythmia This are many diferent causes of cardiac arrhythmia, these can be divided into cardiac and non-cardiac causes. Non-cardiac causes are generally secondary, and include medications, drug abuse; metabolic or endocrine issues, especially in the thyroid; an electrolyte imbalance; neurologic factors; autonomic reflexes; situational factors such as prolonged bed rest; and autoimmunity. Cardiac causes include acute or chronic ischemic heart disease, vascular heart disease, valvular heart disease, or degenerative primary electrical disease. Ultimately, the causes act by three mechanisms: depressed automaticity of the heart, conduction block, or escape pacemakers and rhythms. There are generally two types of problems that result in bradycardias: disorders of the sinoatrial node (SA node), and disorders of the atrioventricular node (AV node). With sinus node dysfunction (sometimes called sick sinus syndrome), there may be disordered automaticity or impaired conduction of the impulse from the sinus node into the surrounding atrial tissue (an "exit block"). It is difficult and sometimes impossible to assign a mechanism to any particular bradycardia, but the underlying mechanism is not clinically relevant to treatment, which is the same in both cases of sick sinus syndrome: a permanent pacemaker.

Atrioventricular conduction disturbances (aka: AV block; 1o AV block, 2o type I AV block, 2o type II AV block, 3o AV block) may result from impaired conduction in the AV node, or anywhere below it, such as in the bundle of HIS. Patients with bradycardia have likely acquired it, as opposed to having it congenitally. Bradycardia is more common in older patients.

Symptoms, Signs, and Diagnosis Bradycardias may produce no symptoms, mild fatigue or faintness, or significant hemodynamic upset (eg, hypotension, angina, heart failure). The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of symptoms and signs but is confirmed by ECG. Patients having bradyarrhythmia must be treated immediately if they are having hypotension, cerebral or cardiac ischemia, heart failure, and/or, in acute MI, frequent ventricular ectopic beats.Making the patient position supine with the legs elevated can be helpful in ameliorating hypotensive sequelae. Atropine 0.5 to 1 mg is given rapidly IV; and may be repeated at 3- to 5-minute intervals. Total dose may go upto 0.04 mg/kg (total, 2 to 3 mg). If the patient is unable to toerate atropine or is ineffective, an IV infusion of isoproterenolcan be started at 1 to 4 µg/minute and drip rate adjusted to produce a ventricular rate of 60 beats/minute. If none of these are successful or contraindicated, then temporary pacemakers should be inserted.

Cardiac pacemakers: More than 85% of patients having pacemaker are more than 64 years and about half of them are treated for high-degree AV block and almost other half for sick sinus syndrome. Insertion of permanent pacemaker has reduced the high mortality associated with these conditions. Active elderly patients may get more benefit from dual-chamber AV synchronous pacemakers which improves maximal exercise cardiac output and work capacitycompared to traditional fixed-rate ventricular pacemakers. Additionally, the incidence of atrial fibrillation and the mortality rate is greater in patients with ventricular pacemakers than patients having atrial or dual-chamber AV synchronous pacemakers. The incidence of atrial fibrillation is 47% in patients > 70 with sick sinus syndrome having a ventricular pacemaker and in 9% in those who are having a dual-chamber pacemaker after 7 years; the mortality rates were reported as 72% and 51%, respectively.

Thus, for an otherwise healthy person who are in sinus rhythm and need pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome an AV synchronous pacemaker should be preferred. Complications of Pacemakers These are rare but significant. There may be abrupt loss of pacing due to battery failure, fibrosis around the catheter site, myocardial perforation, lead fracture, or electrode dislodgment. This may result in bradycardia or even asystole. Perforation may result in pericardial friction rub or, rarely, tamponade. Rarely, there may be extrusion of the pulse generator or the pacing wire through the skin. All patients with a permanent pacemaker should undergo regular follow-up.
