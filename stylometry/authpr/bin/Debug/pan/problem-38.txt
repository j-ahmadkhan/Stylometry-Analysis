The word "current" has several meanings, all of which have connotations of dynamism, freshness, relevance. It can mean "up to the present moment" - that which is new and fresh. It can also describe patterns of movement in elements such as air, water, or electricity - patterns that can be difficult to see, but that are capable of moving with great force and creating immense amounts of energy. When applied to electricity, it can even be synonymous with "power" - as in "Danger - Live Current!" These meanings even place it at the root of the word "currency" - that is, a substance can hold value (power), and that can at any moment be redeemed at that token value. It's little wonder, therefore, that the word is often chosen as a name for news media. It connotes a sense of something flowing toward the audience, something that is potent, up-to-the-minute, and immediate. Yet the media that use it might seem to have little else in common. Current: The Newspaper About Public Broadcasting in the United States Current - one version of it, at least - is a newspaper that covers topics related to public radio and public television. Current and the Firing of Bob Edwards Having such a public meeting place has been important for public broadcasting when internal events threatened to weaken it through internecine conflict. One such event was when Bob Edwards, the iconic host of National Public Radio's Morning Edition and a beloved figure to many public radio listeners, was fired after thirty years with the program. Edwards' distinctive voice and distinguished delivery were, for many people, the voice of public radio, and his departure caused a great deal of internal conflict. Some people felt that his firing was an ominous sign that National Public Radio was sacrificing gravitas and integrity in search of some more exciting or entertaining sound - that they were, in short, compromising their principles and their very identity in the hopes of competing with more vapid, attention-grabbing forms of media. As it turned out, the firing had happened because National Public Radio felt that Morning Edition's sound had been too much the same for too long, and wanted Edwards to switch to a two-host format. This Edwards did not want to do, and National Public Radio was unwilling to allow the program's format to remain as it was. Edwards urged listeners to remember that everything must change, that he would still be on public radio in another venue, and to give Morning Edition's new format, and new hosts, a fair chance. Current's role as a place for public broadcasting's widely scattered, heterogeneous community to come together was an important part of helping National Public Radio (and Edwards) through what might have been a disaster for both. Current.tv: Al Gore's Television Website In the early years of the 2000s, several websites thought it would be a good idea to challenge YouTube's dominance in the "homemade video made available to everyone" field. One of the more serious - that is, less given to being taken over by videos of people's cats playing the piano - was the site established by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Current took much of its identity, of course - and still does - from the inspiration of its founder, Al Gore. In describing his motivation for creating Current, Gore placed it in a historial context that went all the way back to medieval times. In particular, he pointed out that back when monastery libraries were the place where most books and other printed materials were housed, access to them was very limited. The libraries were literally cloistered, and books could be seen (and certainly read) only by a select few. When Gutenberg and his printing press came along, this changed. Books, and the ideas they contained, became available to many more people. This, Gore said, set the stage for the elevated, well-informed public discourse that helped to shape the founding of the United States (but which, he went on to say, had been severely undermined by the domination of broadcast television over the public political forum). It could be argued, of course, that this has never been true in American history - not after Gutenberg, not when the United States was founded, perhaps not at any time. Slavery and its ever-tainted legacies of bigotry and fear certainly give the lie to the idea that the political origins of the United States derive from an open, free-flowing marketplace of ideas in which any individual could contribute to the public forum - as does the exclusion of women and non-landowners from public discussion. Discrimination against non-landowners was the first type of exclusion to be rectified; women would not be permitted even to have the vote until 1920. African-Americans technically received the right to vote in 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution established "equal protection" - that is, that no citizen of the United States could have his or her citizen-based rights abrogated in any way. This was not enough for most of America, however, and the Fifteenth Amendment, passed in 1870, specified that no group could be treated differently or discriminated against in any way based on race, creed, or color. This only launched a long series of attempts, many of them largely successful, to indirectly rob African-Americans of the vote using methods such as a poll tax, a literacy test, or - in the most recent example - by requiring voters to apply for increasingly complicated forms of photographic identification, and then selectively denying the applications of individuals who, as it happened, were African-American. This last example took place in September 2012. Of course, it also took place during the re-election campaign of the United States' first African-American president, showing that American public life has made significant progress from the days when its Constitution had to be amended in order to clarify that people must not be treated as less than human - but it is an indication that the principles of free and open participation in a democracy cannot be taken for granted, but must be constantly defended . All of this is not to question the validity of the principle that Gore wished to uphold - only to point out that, to the extent that he was presenting it as a lost ideal disrupted by television's dominance, he is indulging in nostalgia for something that never existed, and might be wiser to present it as an ideal toward which we are still moving. This is a fine idea, and perhaps somewhat less open to being historically and factually discredited than his first. Yet it must be acknowledged that the merit of an idea can only be judged by the people participating in the marketplace, and they will judge it based upon their own notions of merit, using their own set of values. Was the idea that humans should not be enslaved any more meritorious in 1865 than it had been for the previous two hundred years? Apparently not, because it did not win in the marketplace of ideas even then; it had to be enforced by the rule of law. As it came to dominate public discussion in America, Gore said, and became the most prevalent provider of information for Americans, it brought about a certain level of decay in the public forum. Most citizens are excluded from truly participating in the discussion, because only the wealthiest people can provide content and air it - so the subject and content of public discussions about politics and other issues that are germane to the public weal is determined by a very small group of the most wealthy and influential in America. Both when it launched and when it reinvented itself, many in the online media world were skeptical - partly that Current could engage its viewers/users to the extent that Gore and his team seemed to think possible, but primarily that they could make this model pay. many were expecting to hear the same story from both firms: a reiteration of the great ideas behind their service, a testament to how much their users loved them, and a cautious projection that making money might, perhaps, be on the table in the future - but it was secondary to continuing to do the fantastic things they did. From Evan Williams, they got what they expected. Seeing the financial success of this venture - seeing it victorious in the marketplace of products - makes one feel more sanguine about its prospects in the marketplace of ideas. It suggests that perhaps Al Gore was not merely indulging in a beautiful idealism when he laid out his principles for the marketplace of ideas that he wished to create. His vision was further validated when, in 2007, Al Gore and his co-founder Joel Hyatt won the first-ever-awarded Emmy Award for interactive television. Current's, and Current.tv's, history has not, however, been one unbroken string of successes. When it was first founded, it was immediately slammed with lawsuits over its name - going back to the introduction to this piece and the appeal of the word current as a name and descriptor for media outlets. One of the litigants was Minnesota Public Radio, which produces an ultra-cool radio music show called Current. MPR claimed that it has applied to register the name "The Current" some time before Current TV adopted its name. Their argument was puzzling, however, first because nothing on Current TV was called "The Current"; secondly because Current TV had the word "TV" in the name, making it unlikely to be confused with anything on the radio; and thirdly because Minnesota Public Radio is, as its name implies, in the business of public radio - suggesting that they might have been supportive, rather than litigious, toward a media outlet that aimed to provide a venue for members of the public to participate in public discourse. The other litigant was Current Communications, a company that provides broadband over power lines. Again, it seems unlikely that such a company would lose business due to being confused with Current TV - though it is possible that Current Communications, knowing that Current TV had been founded by Al Gore and knowing something about its aims and mission, feared some degree of brand dilution or even taint from the characteristics that would be publicly known about Current TV. If so, they had little to fear; the brand is now primarily associated with media innovation and financial success, rather than with Al Gore.
