When you turn your imagination on it's not difficult to imagine those pioneering days when French Lick Indiana got its name from early Frenchmen and the generous mineral licks in the area. Of course, the French traders who discovered the mineral springs bubbling up from the ground did not live in accommodations anything like the Versailles splendors the resort halls emulate. More likely, they emerged from tents comprising wooden frames and animal skins strung over, to hunt the deer and buffalo that just loved to lick the salty deposits the mineral water left upon the ground and rocks. But mankind is a curious thing. We're not content to leave things as they are. In the early 1800's settlers of British extraction started bottling the "Pluto Water" from the springs and selling it in nearby settlements. With Doc Bowles' first hotel in place - a triple-level settler style frame building - the nascent community began to thrive thanks to the sudden influx of tourists arriving to drink and soak up the mineral waters. By the eighteen fifties, French Lick has become a well-established railway station. This seemed a far cry from when Tom Taggert turned the sleepy little resort into an international attraction , albeit with a little help from his friends at the Monon Railroad. Train buffs still stop by the old depot when they have the opportunity to catch up on the magic. Do it. There's a great restaurant and bar too In those days, visitors trained in from Chicago, Cincinnati, Louisville and St. Louis.They gambled, golfed, soaked up the hot springs and enjoyed the natural beauty of the area as if there were no tomorrow. Today, people still come here to do these self-same things - and also to enjoy the natural beauty of Southern Indiana for we are become an eco-tourist nation. Our fine hotel has always boasted the sports of golf, tennis, croquet, and baseball. There was once a gambling casino between the Pluto and Proserpine Springs, and this provided bowling alleys, a gym, and billiard tables. We had a dancing hall that was one of the largest in the county at that time, and was encased in glass that was a nine-day's wonder then. The surrounding woodlands continue to provide hiking trails for those intent on taking their daily exersise. Today, both French Lick Springs Resort and West Baden Springs Hotel are undergoing $350 million historic restorations and expansions. We reopened the resort as French Lick Springs Resort & Casino in Novem ber 2006 to a fanfare of four hundred forty fully renovated rooms with easy going access to the casino, the new event center, the new restaurants, the exciting retail shops, and, of course our pride, the fully restored public areas too. The West Baden Springs Hotel re-opened with two hundred forty six luxurious hotel rooms provide fascinating historic interest too. Lyme disease can take a month to develop and symptoms vary between different people. Commonest is a reddish "bulls-eye" rash which may be accompanied by fever, musculoskeletal pain and a general sense of feeling unwell. It's more an irritation. If you develop it, get it fixed.
