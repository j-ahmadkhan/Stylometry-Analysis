Selling a Home Planning to sell a home can be rewarding or frustrating depending on your purpose. Many homeowners will make money from the sale of their property. However, there are specific methods to make sure you do make the most from the sale of your principal or investment property, thus minimize the tax on the gain. Here below are some of the different things you may look at before putting your property on the market to help you think and assess on your own before making with your final decision: Sit with your accountant. Find out what tax you will need to pay on the gain and if there are other hidden costs to you. Removing clutter. When you want your property to stand out more, keep the place clean - removing all unnecessary items that aren't important. Tidy up the garden, make sure that it gives a good vibe. Find the right agent. As there are many agents and companies offering their most promising agent, always be wise and don't just rely on one agent, ask a few agents for an appraisal instead. Look at what on the market and which agency has a dominant market place. Understand the prices. Generate an idea of how much your property is valued. Ask around, if you've seen properties like yours on the market, see what they sold for. Do your own research so that when an agent comes out to meet you, you'll already have an idea and can be more prepared for what the appraiser will say, at which you can judge whether to trust to to look for another to be trusted. Marketing tactics. Each agency uses different methods of marketing; there is no right and wrong way to market a property. Every agent will have there own method but make sure it what suits you as well. Some may ask for ridiculous amount of money to promote your property, and remember, don't give in. Make sure they work in with you to best promote your property and not to ask for money. Selling your home can be a puzzling process. You undoubtedly will have fears about who do you trust, how much will you get after commission and advertising and will you get hassled to drop your price so the agent can get an easy deal? Do things on your own first, then look and ask for help when it is time to have one.
