This had been a popular theory but recently a small group of scientists believe that this could well be wrong. Evidence for the Meteor Theory came from a thin layer of rock, 65 milion years old called the KT boundary which we find exposed in cliffs etc. The KT boundary contains two crucial elements to support the Meteor Theory. High concentrations of iridium were discovered in the layer in 1979, which scientist thought could only have come from an asteroid. Then under the iridium they discovered a layer of tiny balls of condensed rock thought to have been vapourised by a massive impact. Dr Alan Hildebrand of the University of Calgary suggested that the impact must have happened at the site of a crater known as Chicxulub in the Yucatan peninsula, Chemical analysis confirmed that the spherules had come from rocks in that crater. The dinosaurs died out around 65 million years ago, at around the same time as this KT layer was formed, so you can see why this is such a convincing argument in favour of the Meteor Theory. However Professor Gerta Keller of Princeton and Professor Wolfgang Stinnesbeck of the University of Karlsruhe along with a small group of scientists believe the Meteor Theory to be incorrect.

They believed that the Chicxulub crater is too old to have killed off the dinosaurs.They came to this conclusion by studying rock formations in Mexico where the iridium layer was separated from the spherule layer by many metres of sandstone. This new theory caused a lot of controversy as supporters of the Meteor Theory such as Professor Jan Smit of Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam ridiculed the idea. Smit countered by stating that the sandstone could have been deposited there by tsunami waves caused by the asteroid, and so the Meteor Theory still stands. But Keller's team went on to find evidence that the sandstone had not been deposited at the same time, evidence such as the presence of ancient worm burrows. Their findings suggested that there was a gap of around 300,000 years between the spherule layer from the crater and the iridium from an asteroid, so there must have been more than one impact to create this. They stated that the crater impact was too old to have killed the dinosaurs, so there must have been another impact somewhere else, however no evidence of this has been found. Because this theory brought much publicity and revitalised interest in the debate, in 2001 an international group of scientists extracted rock cores from deep within the Yucatan crater to try and solve the issue once and for all.

However the results were inconclusive with each side believing that the evidence supported their own side of the argument. There are other theories too. Prof Dave Archibald of San Diego State University believes that because some creatures survived, such as frogs, that dinosaurs could not have died from exposure to acid rain from a massive drop in temperature due to a huge impact on the earth. Dr Norman MacLeod of the Natural History Museum in London is one of a large number of scientists who believe the dinosaurs were already extinct due to climate change before any impacts had occured at all.
