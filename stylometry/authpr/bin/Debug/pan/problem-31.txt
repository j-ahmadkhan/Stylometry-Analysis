The over-the-counterelk nonpermit-tags were offered begining in 2008. The tags are for veryspecific and limited locations where the Arizona Game and FishDepartment is attempting to create areas with few or no resident elk. Certain areas of thestate have been identified as "Limited Population Management Zones," which areareas in which the Department does not want resident elk herds due to conflictswith private landowners and/or the management focus is on other wildlife, suchas pronghorn or deer. In the past, our general hunt structures have not alwaysmet our management goals in these areas, which is why we are implementing thenonpermit-tag elk hunts in certain isolated areas around the state. Elk numbers in these hunt areas are verylow ; therefore, hunt success is expected to be very low .However, one advantage of these hunts is that they afford the opportunity tohunt with family and friends, which hasn't always been possible because of thedifficulty in getting drawn for draw hunts. Hunters need tobe attentive to the hunt area boundaries , as they aredifferent in most cases than the unit boundaries. Some of these areashave significant amounts of private property .Hunters who obtain these over-the-counter elk tags should make sure theycontact the property owner and obtain permission beforehunting on private land. These hunts will notaffect your bonus points but do count toward your one-elk-per-calendar-year baglimit. See below for detailedinformation on boundary descriptions, season dates, frequently asked questions,maps, and other information. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's): Question: WHAT arenonpermit-tags?
