Things like this should be carried on your person orpacked in a carry-on bag that will fit under the seat. Remember,the only way to be sure your valuables are not damaged or lost isto keep them with you. Even if your bag is not lost, it could bedelayed for a day or two. Don't put perishables in a checked bag;they may spoil if it is delayed. It is wise to put items that youwill need during the first 24 hours in a carry-on bag (e.g.toiletries, a change of underwear). Check with the airline for itslimits on the size, weight, or number of carry-on pieces. (There isno single federal standard.) If you are using more than oneairline, check on all of them. Inquire about your flight; differentairplanes can have different limits. Don't assume that the flightwill have unlimited closet space for carry-on garment bags; somemay have to be checked. If you plan to go shopping at yourdestination and bring your purchases aboard as carry-on, keep thelimits in mind. If you check these purchases, however, carry thereceipts separately; they may be necessary for a claim if themerchandise is lost or damaged. Don't put anything into a carry-onbag that could be considered a weapon (e.g. scissors, penknife). Checked baggage is also subject to limits. On mostdomestic and international flights, it's two checked bags (three ifyou don't have any carry-on luggage). There can be an extra chargeif you bring more, or if you exceed the airline's limits on thesize of the bags. On some flights between two foreign cities, yourallowance may be based on the weight of the bags rather than thenumber of pieces. The same two bags that cost you nothing to checkwhen you started your trip could result in expensive excess-baggagecharges under a weight system. Ask the airlines about the limit forevery segment of your international trip before you leave home,especially if you have a stopover of a day or two or if you arechanging carriers. The bags you check should be labeled- inside andout-with your name, address and phone number. Add the name andaddress of a person to contact at your destination if it'spractical to do so. Almost all of the bags that are misplaced byairlines do turn up sooner or later. With proper labeling, the bagand its owner can usually be reunited within a few hours. Don'toverpack a bag. This puts pressure on the latches, making it easierfor them to pop open. If you plan to check any electricalequipment, glassware, small appliances, pottery, typewriters,musical instruments or other fragile items, they should be packedin a container specifically designed to survive rough handling*preferably a factory-sealed carton or a padded hard- shell carryingcase. except for toiletries and medicinestotaling no more than 75 ounces, it is illegal and extremelydangerous to carry on board or check in your luggage any of thefollowing hazardous materials:* Aerosols: Polishes, waxes,degreasers, cleaners, etc. * Corrosives: Acids, cleaners, wet cellbatteries, etc. * Flammables: Paints, thinners, lighter fluid,liquid reservoir lighters, cleaners, adhesives, camp stoves orportable gas equipment with fuel, etc. * Explosives: Fireworks,flares, signal devices, loaded firearms, gunpowder, etc. (Smallarms ammunition for personal use may be transported in checkedluggage if it is securely packed in material designed for thatpurpose. These may not be placed in carry-on baggage.) *Radioactives: Betascopes, radiopharmaceuticals, uninstalledpacemakers, etc. * Compressed gases: Tear gas or protective- typesprays, oxygen cylinders, divers' tanks (unless they're empty),etc. * Infectious substances * Poisonous materials: Rat poison,etc. During air travel bloodcoagulability rises steadily and blood flow slows down, especiallyin the lower legs. About 3% of air travelers develop clots, usuallypainlessly, but some clots cause pain and swelling. If a clottravels to the lung it can cause pain, fainting and death. A clotin the leg is called deep vein thrombosis, DVT. A clot in the lungis pulmonary embolism, PE. Clots also form in the arterial systemand in the heart, leading to heart failure and stroke. Injuries areeasily avoided by simple steps such as flexing the legs frequently,and many airlines have begun telling passengers aboutthis. Air travel thrombosis is mostly preventable,mainly by flexing the legs frequently during air travel. Frequent leg flexing is thebest preventive for ECS. The blood needs to be pushed through theone-way valve system in the veins by contractions of the largemuscles. Do it five times or more, firmly and deliberately but notstrenuously. If you are bothering your seat mates, you are doing ittoo vigorously. The UK Department of Health recommends 30 minuteintervals, more frequently if you have risk factors such asathletic training or a history of DVT. Avoid elastic "support" hose. They are not the sameas graduated compression stockings. Support hose have the sameelasticity along the entire length and may actually be harmful.Medical compression hose have greater compression at the ankles andgradually less and less going up the calf. If your stockings arenot much tighter at the ankle, they are not the kind you need. Stay hydrated: Experts recommend drinking water(or other non-alcoholic non-caffeine beverages) to avoid increasedblood viscosity during air travel. In a study by Hamada, twentytest subjects drank plenty of water, one cup per hour, during anine hour flight. They developed significant increases in bloodthickness and urine output. Blood samples from arm and lower legwere taken. Viscosity (thickness) increased in the lower leg,exactly where clots are likely to form. Calories: During air travel youdon't need energy-boosting carbohydrates. If you are countingcalories, look for stores carry low-calorie isotonic beverages. Oryou might prefer low-calorie isotonic powder mixes such as Isostar,especially if you want to avoid the bulk and weight of bottleddrinks. Pretzels: If you search"hydration" on Google, you will find other alternatives such asdrinking water and munching a few pretzels, but this leaves a lotto chance. Until further scientific studies are done, one cup perhour of an isotonic beverage seems prudent. traveling withchildren, especially young children, special responsibilitiesexist. Here are some tips that can make the trip pleasant for allconcerned. Planning ahead is essential for any air trip, andeven more so when children are involved. Make sure you keep handyany supplies you will need to take care of any normal or specialneeds for the child. Assume the worst: every seat will beallocated, the toilets will not have changing tables, the airlinewill not have any suitable food, you will be delayed for severalhours, and any checked luggage will be lost. Carrying all thechild's essentials is important, especially if your child is on aspecial diet or on medication. The flight attendant is not responsible forsupervising your child. On a very long flight from Australia to theUS a parent, traveling alone with a toddler, fell asleep. A fewminutes later a flight attendant carrying the child woke the parentand informed her that the child had been wandering around the oneof the aircraft galleys - a place with all sorts of dangerously hotor sharp objects that could have easily injured the child. Also beaware that when walking about the aircraft with your child, hotdrinks and food, silverware, and other hazards are within theirreach. No matter how tired you may get, your child is still yourresponsibility. It is recommended that infants be put into a childrestraint system appropriate for their weight. Most Approved Australian Safety Standard childrestraint seats designed for use in motor vehicles are suitable foruse in an aircraft, if used in accordance with the seatmanufacturer's instructions. For travelers from overseas, Canadian,European and USA standard motor vehicle child seats are acceptable.Additionally, dedicated aviation restraint systems approved bythose Airworthiness Authorities are also acceptable. This includesa device from the USA marketed as the Kidsflysafe CARES'. Childbooster seats are only allowed to be used in seats whichincorporate a shoulder harness. For that reason, booster seats arenot allowed to be used on standard airline seating. As a guide,once a child has outgrown their full harness child restraint, it issafe for them to use the aircraft seat & lap belt. An airline may supply child restraint seats or mayallow you to use your own. When making your booking, check to seewhat arrangements the airline you are travelling with has for thesafe transport of your infant. Once you have confirmed theacceptable use of the child restraint, think about thefollowing: Find a way to conveniently carry the infant, bags and possiblya child restraint through airports and into and out ofaircraft, Check with the airline you are flying with and follow theirrecommendations for using child restraint systems, Check whether it is a requirement of the airline you aretravelling with, that child restraints are used. Small children enjoy reaching out and exploring. Ifthey are seated beside the aisle they could get hurt if their armsget bumped by a passing person or serving cart. Ideally, tworesponsible adults should sit one on either side of a small child.Alternatively, the child can be seated on a row with a window onone side and a responsible adult on the other. If an infant is in achild restraint, that restraint should not impede another personmaking their way to the aisle so in that situation it is best thatthey be placed in the window seat. Try to avoid bringing along toys that are sharp,heavy, or that break easily. If the child has an electronic game,only allow them to use it during the cruise portion of flight.Electronic games may interfere with an aircraft's navigationalsystem during other phases of the flight. As expected, if you do not have children, but are pregnant,some special care is worth considering. Air travel is generally safe for pregnant women, as long asthere are no complications with the pregnancy and you are notflying too close to your due date. However, traveling pregnant doescome with some warnings, such as an increased risk of blood clotsand Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) , especially during long flights. Toensure safe and comfortable air travel when pregnant, follow thesetips: Be aware of dehydration on airplanes, which can be worse whenpregnant. Make sure you have plenty of water with you (avoid caffeine andalcohol). Pack vitamin-rich fresh fruit (grapes, plums, oranges or driedapricots). Wear support hose and shoes with adjustable straps in case yourfeet swell. As always with flying, get up and walk around the cabin everytwo hours or so. Take an eye mask and ear plugs and wear loose, comfortableclothing. Rest as much as possible while in the air. According to the American College of Obstetricians& Gynecologists, air travel is safest for pregnant women duringthe second trimester: weeks 18 to 24. If you are considering aflight during your pregnancy, check with both your doctor and theairline before you book. General consensus in the medical communitysuggests it is best not to travel pregnant before 12 weeks due tomorning sickness and possible increased risk of miscarriage. Thoughmany pregnant women have no trouble flying in the first trimester,it is always better to err on the safe side and consult yourphysician. After 28 weeks, when the risk of going into laborincreases, most airlines will require a letter from your doctorstating that you are fit for air travel while pregnant andconfirming your estimated due date. If you are more than 36 weekspregnant, many airlines will not let you fly due to the increasedrisk of delivering onboard. Especially during pregnancy, reserving the rightseat on the airplane can make a difference. You will need to beable to get up and move around the plane. Try and reserve aspacious seat when you make your booking. Many airlines' Web siteshave information about the varying legroom on each of their seats.If you plan to travel pregnant, it's worth spending a few extrabucks to get a bit more room. Be aware though that traditionalextra legroom seats, such as those on the exit aisles, are oftennot permitted to those who are pregnant. Ok! With children or not, you are now ready to take off. Regarding the amount ofairlines, have you ever wondered what are the largest airlines inUK? By 2006, the majority of allpassengers travelling by air to or from the UK are carried by UKairlines, of which there are around forty, and at the end of 2006the UK air transport fleet numbered 963 aircraft, flying just under1.2 million flights and averaging over eight hours of flyingdaily. Together the two largest airlinesas measured by passenger numbers; British Airways and easyJet,account for nearly half of the 127 million passengers flown on UKairlines. In terms of capacity, both available and used, BritishAirways is again the largest airline, whilst easyJet is pushed intothird place by Virgin Atlantic Airways. British Airways passengerflights also account for over 50 per cent of all cargo carried byUK airlines, and when combined with its cargo operations theairline carries over 60 per cent of all cargo carried by UKairlines. No-frills carriers, such as easyJet, has had a significant impacton air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5million passengers, up from just 4.3 million in 1996. They are responsible for the growth of regionalairports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations,serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier. The annual rate of growth in the overall demandfor air travel has remained stable since 1975, averaging 5.8 percent annually. Recent growth is beingserviced by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditionalcarriers which, since 2000, have experienced flat or decliningtraffic levels. In response, traditionalcarriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price,leading to lower prices on the short haul routes serviced by thissector, especially in business fares. Theyhave also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launchedno-frills subsidiaries of their own . Obviously, this has an impact in British airports. Whilst airport development in the UK is subjectto local planning authority processes, the government regardsairports as an important part of the national infrastructure andwhich therefore requires their development to be planned with astrategic approach. To support this, thegovernment began a three year public consultation process with thepublication in December 2000 of The Futureof Aviation consultation document. Thisoutlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views onhow they should be addressed in any future policy. The strategyseeks to minimise new airport development by making best use ofexisting facilities, and specific policiesinclude: Expansion of Edinburgh Airport with an additional runway, toaccommodate up to 20mppa by 2020, and the recommendation thatmeasures be taken to safeguard a possible additional runway atGlasgow Cardiff Airport to remain the main airport serving South Wales,to be supported by additional terminal capacity and improvedsurface links Support for the development of capacity within the existingboundaries of Belfast Airport and early consideration of the futuredevelopment of the City of Derry Airport. Expansion of Manchester Airport to increase terminal capacityto support up to 50mppa, accompanied by "stringent measures" tominimise noise disruption and ensure air quality standards. Thepossibility of extending the runway at Liverpool Airport. Expansion of Birmingham Airport with an additional runway,accompanied by "stringent measures" to minimise noise disruptionand ensure air quality standards, and improvements to surfaceaccess. The option to expand East Midlands Airport with anadditional runway is to be kept under review. Development of Bristol Airport with a runway extension andadditional terminal, to support up to 12mppa, having due regard tothe environmental impact of such developments, and support for thedevelopment of Bournemouth Airport, conditional on surface accessimprovements and minimal or compensated impacts on sensitiveecological sites. Expansion of Stansted Airport with an additional runway, with"strict environmental controls", as soon as possible and in theexpectation of achieving this around 2011/2012. Development ofHeathrow Airport, conditional on meeting "stringent environmentallimits", to include an additional runway in the 2015 2020timeframe, and " an urgent program of work and consultation to findsolutions to the key environmental issues at Heathrow ". Expansionof Gatwick Airport with an additional runway after the planningagreement preventing this expires in 2019.
