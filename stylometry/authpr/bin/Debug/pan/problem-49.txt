Was Euclid a Plagiarist? I found researching this essay as frustrating as I found geometry at school. To be honest, I didn't enjoy school much at all. It all seemed so futile. Perhaps if the exercises were more practical it could have made a difference.

I might have been interested to know how far the tuck shop was from swimming pool, had I been flying straight as a bird. Why was I so frustrated? The Chatnoir facility the university uses is really cranky, and half the time the students who are supposed to fix it are out partying instead. Something to do looking out for copycats, I suppose. But what's the point of going to university without learning to think for yourself?

To this day Alexandria - s econd largest city in Egypt - has an atmosphere more Mediterranean than Middle Eastern, and well deserves its historic name "The Pearl of the Mediterranean" . That's because its ambiance and cultural heritage set it poles apart from Cairo that's 225 kilometers away. Alexander the Great established it as a supply station in 331 BC while he was busy conquering the world as a surprisingly young man still. The settlement grew into the capital of the Graeco-Roman Egyptian Empire.

Sailors found it easily (even at night) because it had a huge lighthouse called "Pharos" that was one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It was a romantic place too. After the crude orgies and drunken bouts it's said Alexander engaged with in company of his lusty soldiers, he planted rows of palm trees along the River Nile, and built galleys to sail upon it.

That's where the stormy affair between Mark Antony and Cleopatra took root, although quite what this has to with geometry eludes me. Alexandria was a center of learning in the ancient world. But it had reverted to a sparsely populated fishing village by the time Napoleon Bonaparte discovered it, and many tourists choose to avoid it these days.

Historic Setting It's not easy to imagine what life was like in Euclid's days. I doubt they had things like tape-measures, and they certainly didn't have theodolites. Yet at that time they were already building perfectly-proportioned pyramids nd temples. To do that they needed ways to peg things out.

Euclid of Alexandria (if that really was his name and he was an individual who actually lived) remains one of the most famous names in mathematics. Proclus - the last major Greek philosopher who was around in the 5th Century, opined that: "not much younger than the pupils of Plato was Euclid, who irrefutably demonstrated the things which had been previously only loosely proven." The first point to note is there is nothing suspect in the inconsistent dates. That's because they had no calendars and historians were more at pains to hammer fragments into logically consistent narratives. However, although we do not know indubitably to which chapter of Archimedes' work Proclus refers to, the argument was judged well and good until Hjelmslev challenged it in the 1930's. Hjelmslev went as far as arguing that the reference to Euclid was added to Archimedes' book by a third party at a later stage. Indeed I must confess that I encounter it as a rather surprising inconsistency.

Moreover, it was not the custom at that time to give such references to third parties. There are none elsewhere. Plagiarism ruled in ancient times.

However Bulmer-Thomas seemed to disagree when he wrote ... although it is no longer possible to rely on this reference, a general consideration of Euclid's works ... still shows that he must have written after such pupils of Plato as Eudoxus, and before Archimedes." Did Euclid Really Exist? Historians have narrowed the answers to just three. I add a fourth after I list these (i) Euclid was a historical character who wrote the Elements and the other works attributed to him. (ii) Euclid was the leader of a team of mathematicians working at Alexandria. They all contributed to writing the 'complete works of Euclid', even continuing to write books under Euclid's name after his death. (iii) Euclid was not an historical character.

The 'complete works of Euclid' were written by a team of mathematicians at Alexandria who took the name Euclid from the historical character Euclid of Megara who had lived about 100 years earlier. There is quite convincing evidence accept that Euclid was a historical character who wrote "The Elements" and the other works attributed to him . After all, everyone believed this for more than two thousand years and there is little evidence to disprove this even now. While it is true that there are stylistic differences between some books, other authors have varied their style as they evolved. Besides, Euclid undoubtedly based "his" Elements on previous writer's works whose style inevitably knocked through. Moreover Euclid undoubtedly built up a mathematics school at Alexandria, and (like most researchers) may well have enlisted the help of his better students.

However theory (ii) goes much further than this, by suggesting that different books were written by different mathematicians. Other than the differences in style referred to above, there seems little direct evidence to prove this. Theory (iii) that Euclid's are the work of a team of mathematicians at Alexandria (named after Euclid of Megara) may however not be as fanciful as they first seem.

After all, a group of French students formed a group in 1934 to write a treatise under the name of Bourbaki. If this was not Reverse Plagiarism, then what else was it?

This introduces the possibility that Euclid may possibly have been mingling in gay circles. After all, Athens is believed to have been a gay old place in those days, with some saying that Socrates was "the epitome of the Athenian institution of paiderastia, or boy love". The philosophers main contribution was the " Socratic Teaching Method ". This involved encouraging others to think for themselves by answering questions (as opposed to forcing down his own ideas and views). All things come to an end. In Socrates' own case, he willingly drank the hemlock that killed him.

This was after he was sentenced to death on charges of corrupting the morals of the youth of Athens. Some say this was a cover up of his underlying criticism of political and religious institutions. We do know that "some of his adoring students came up with a plan for him to escape ... but he refused the opportunity". Something of a waste in more ways than one.

One great frustration is that not one of Euclid's works is provided with a preface. These might have revealed something his character (which Pappus describes was "... most fair and well disposed towards all who were able in any measure to advance mathematics, careful in no way to give offence, and although an exact scholar not vaunting himself ..."). relates the following concerning Euclid. When a trainee geometry student asked Euclid "What shall I get by learning these things?" Euclid called his slave and said "Give him threepence since he must make gain out of what he learns" (although I'm not convinced they had British tickeys in those days. Euclid's Mountain Top Without a shadow of doubt his most famous work is his treatise on mathematics that he called "The Elements".

It was a compendium of knowledge that became the heartland of maths teaching for 20 Centuries, although perhaps none of it was his original thinking, or so it seems. What the work does do though is to organize the material from various sources into a cohesive whole. In this regard it's quite compelling to note that Euclid is quite clearly using earlier textbooks, since he defines words such as "oblong", ":rhombus", and "rhomboid" that he does not refer to elsewhere.

Euclid starts with these definitions followed by five postulates. Postulates (Considered Proven) First Three Postulates The first three of these are postulates of construction (for example the first postulate states that it is possible to draw a straight line between any two points). This implicitly assumes the existence of points, lines, circles and other geometric objects that are deduced from the fact that they exist.

Other assumptions in the postulates are not explicit though. For example, Euclid assumes that there is a unique line joining any two unique pairs of points. Similarly postulates two and three (on producing straight lines and drawing circles respectively) assume the uniqueness of the objects the possibility of whose construction is being postulated. Fourth and Fifth Postulates The fourth and fifth postulates are markedly dissimilar. Postulate four states that all right angles are equal. While this may seem "obvious" it exists in a paradigm that assumes all space is homogeneous - in other words that a figure will be independent of the spatial position in which it exists.

The fifth (parallel) postulate states that one and only one line can be drawn through a point parallel to a given line. It was not until the 19th century that this postulate was dropped, and non-euclidean geometries became the subject of serious study. Notions (not proved but considered self-evident) These are n ot specific geometrical properties, but rather general assumptions (axioms which Euclid calls 'common notions') which allow mathematics to proceed as a deductive science. For example things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other .

The seems to be ample evidence that Euclid (this includes possible assistants and team members) used multiple sources for "The Elements" yet did not acknowledge them. If there was an introduction to the work admitting this then this has vanished in the sands of time. Was Euclid a plagiarist them?

It's a dirty word to many and a slur on his personality. Does it really matter though in the greater scheme of things? If Euclid accumulated ideas in a cohesive way and advanced our understanding of geometry, perhaps it was not such a great sin after all. I'll ask Professor Potthast what he thinks, and let you know.

Euclid may not have been a first class mathematician. However the enduring nature of "The Elements" could earn him the title of the leading mathematics teacher of antiquity, or perhaps even of all time. As a final personal note may I mention that my first school mathematics textbook was an extract from Euclid's Elements. For indeed we have always been a little backward in Africa, and might have preferred to be out on the rugby field instead
