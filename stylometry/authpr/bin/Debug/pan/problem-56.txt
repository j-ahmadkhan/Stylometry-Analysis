Playstation: Changing the nature of VideoGaming The Playstation 2 has a history of changing thenature of gaming. This is through the wide variety of new andinteresting games that are released. Some of these games aredifferent from anything that has come before and this originalityleads on to many others taking up the ideas first seen in PS2games. As an example here is a review of Mirror's Edge whichalthough failing to reach the full heights of popular acclaim didhave some fascinating ideas some of which are still used today. Cheat Codes and Game Mods The availability of cheat codes hasled to a new era in video gaming. Cheats had been used with PCgames quite frequently due to the ability of some clever, PC savvy,people to access the game code and edit it. This could change thenature of the game completely and allow the player to come up withnew gravity effects or fly their character through walls. Inessence these mods, as they came to be known, allowed the playercomplete control over the game and could therefore be used tocreate entirely new ways of playing. Consoles on the other handwere somewhat lacking in this advantage. This is simply becauseit's almost impossible to use a console in the same way as acomputer. You cannot access the internal menu's and code on a gamewhen using a console because they are built solely for the purposeof playing games. To rectify this issue gamedevelopers started building codes into their game that can beaccessed by pressing a select number of buttons on the controller.These buttons have to be pressed at the right time in the rightorder to activate a cheat, and thus cheat codes were born. Thesewere never advertised on the game and it was generally left up tothe player to discover them and then share them with other players.In reality this was rarely the case and most often a game developerwould leak the cheats on to the internet for everyone tosee. These new cheats allowed gamers toplay their games in a new way. For instance Tony HawksSkateboarding games would let you turn off gravity and flythousands of feet into the air. Cheats have been made that let youdo just about anything, from invincibility to invisibility andeverything in between. This began to bring up the question ofwhether it was worth cheating before you completed a game as thecheats could take all of the challenge away. Another new craze that began on thePS2 is the music genre of game. These are everywhere in manydifferent forms and allow the player to play music or sing in linewith a variety of songs. These games generally come with anelectronic gaming pad in the shape of an instrument. The playermust hit the buttons (the notes) in time to the music to achieve ahigh score and unlock new songs. In all the Sony Playstation franchise has in recentyears changed the face of gaming more than once. They continuallyprovide new and amazing technology in a variety of ways that linksin with game developers to produce some of the best gamingexperiences in the world. And all of this from the comfort of yourown home, and even in a portable version. Hopefully Sony willcontinue to produce high quality consoles and high quality games tokeep the gaming population desperate for their next Playstation fixand another new era in gaming. The Sony Playstation and itsdescendants are definitely here to stay.
