Volvo Cars is a Swedish car manufacturer founded in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1927. Currently, the company is owned by Ford Motor Company. The name Volvo is Latin, and literally means "I roll" (in a more modern sense, "I drive"). It was chosen because it was considered a good trademark for a ball bearing as well as for an automobile. Volvo was originally formed as a subsidiary company to the ball bearing maker SKF. It was not until Volvo AB was introduced on the Swedish stock exchange, in 1935, that SKF sold most of the shares in the company.

After that Volvo Cars was owned by Volvo AB until 1999, when it became part of the Ford Motor Company's Premier Automotive Group. Volvo produces cars ranging from SUVs, wagons, and sedans to compact executive sedans and coupes. However, the company's market share is shrinking in the North American market.

New markets such as Russia, China and India are going strong, though, gaining in creased market share. In Russia, Volvo expected sales to double, exceeding 20,000 units by the end of 2007. This would make Russia one of the company's top ten markets.

Already, Volvo can lay claim to the leading position in Russia's luxury car segment. Older models were often compared to tractors, possibly because Volvo AB has always manufactured heavy equipment, first as Bolinder-Munktell, and later u nder the division Volvo Construction Equipment. Considered slow and heavy, the classic, block-shaped Volvo earned the endearment "brick", with the more powerful turbo charged variants known as "turbobricks". More recent models have moved away from the boxy styles of the 1970s and 1980s and built a reputation for sporting performance. But even before the newer, sporty styles were launch, the "turbobricks" had shown their excellence with the phenomenal success of factory-supported Volvo 240 turbos winning both the 1985 European Touring Car Championship and 1986 Australian Touring Car Championship. Volvo's are built to last. Proud owners are often boast of prodigious mileages, with one well-documented 1966 Volvo P1800S having been driven over 2.6 million miles.

According to some figures the average lifespan of a Volvo 19.8 years before it is discarded -- second only to Mercedes. The reliability of a Volvo is considered better than average, and in the USA Volvo dealers are listed by Forbes as the 9th best general car manufacturer, and 6th best for luxury cars. A brief history of Volvo Volvo company was founded in Gothenburg, Sweden in the year 1927 as a subsidiary company wholly owned by SKF. Assar Gabrielsson was appointed as the first managing director and Gustav Larson was the technical manager. The Volvo trademark was first registered by SKF the 11th of May, 1915. It was intended to be used for a special series of ball bearings for the American market, but while s ome pre-series of Volvo-bearings stamped with the brand name 'Volvo' were manufactured, they were never released to the market and so the trademark was never used. Instead, the SKF trademark as it looks today was used for all SKF-products.

It was not until 1927 that the trademark was used again, this time as a trademark and company name for an car. The first Volvo car left the assembly line on the 14th of April, 1927, was called Volvo V4. After this the young company produced closed top and cabriolet vehicles, which were designed to hold strong in the Swedish climate and terrain. The Volvo symbol , a circle with an arrow pointing to the top right, is an ancient chemistry sign for iron and was designed to symbolize the strength of iron used in the car -- as Sweden is known for its quality iron. The diagonal strip of metal across the grille came about to hold the actual symbol in front of the radiator. In the registration application for Volvo logotype in 1927, they simply made a copy of the entire radiator for the V4, viewed from the front. In 1964, Volvo opened its Torslanda plant in Sweden, which is still one of its largest production sites -- chiefly producing large cars and SUVs.

Then in 1965, the Ghent, Belgium plant was opened -- producing chiefly small cars -- which is the company's second largest production site. Finally in 1989, the Uddevalla plant in Sweden was opened. This site is now jointly operated by Volvo Car Corporation and Pininfarina of Italy. A collection of Volvo's most important historical vehicles are now housed t he Volvo Museum, which moved to a permanent location in Arendal at Hisingen on May 30, 1995 after being housed for several years at "The Blue Hangar," at the then closed Torslanda Airport. Acquisitions In the early 1970s, Volvo acquired the passenger car division of the Dutch company DAF, and marketed their small cars as Volvos before releasing the Dutch-built Volvo 340.

The Volvo 340 went on to become one of the biggest-selling cars in the UK market in the 1980s. Volvo Group, as one of the largest manufacturers of commercial vehicles in the world, took the initiative to sell its automobile manufacturing in 1998, in order to focus its efforts on the market for commercial vehicles. Ford saw advantages in acquiring a profitable prestige mid-size European automobile manufacturer, well renowned for its safety aspects, as an addition to its Premier Automotive Group.

The buyout of Volvo Cars was announced on January 28, 1998, and in the following year the acquisition was completed at a price of $6.45 billion USD. As a result of the divestiture, the Volvo trademark is now used by two separate companies: Volvo Group - a manufacturer of commercial vehicles, trucks, buses, industrial equipment and more, owned by Swedish interests. Volvo Cars - a manufacturer of automobiles owned by Ford Motor Company, in its Premier Automotive Group (PAG). Corporate history within Ford Volvo Car Corporation is now part of Ford Motor Company's Premier Automotive Group (PAG) and is the only brand left in the group since the sale of Jaguar, Aston Martin and Land Rover.

Since its acquisition into the PAG, the company has expanded its range of vehicles. After the sale of JLR to Tata of India, Ford decided to keep Volvo Cars despite mounting losses and gross economic down turns. Ford decided to restructure plans for Volvo Cars, pushing it further upmarket alongside the lower end of Mercedes and BMW sedans, wagons, and SUV crossovers. This turnaround was quite evident with the luxurious second generation Volvo S80 and the new small premium crossover Volvo XC60. In around 2009, there were talks about what to do with Volvo Cars in the event of a market failure with US automakers that would include parent FOMOCO.

Swedish interests mounted their concerns after repeated mass layoffs at Volvo, expressing that Sweden needs to enter the spotlight to help its automotive industry. The government was asked to look into a possible state ownership of Volvo, or financing both Volvo Cars and SAAB which was owned by GM. Eventually Volvo responded to heated talks and decided that they did not want to see Volvo Cars fail, so they agreed to help Volvo cut costs through partnerships and even a possible share ownership within a larger consortium. Volvo repeated and stood firm that they would not buy back Volvo cars nor be sole majority owner.

They were only willing to become part share owner of the car unit they once owned. In December 2008, FOMOCO announced that it was considering a sale of the Volvo Cars unit through complex evaluations, but that it would try to make Volvo a more stand alone company. VCNA management is often criticized for canceling the Free Maintenance program it used to offer on its new Automobiles back in 2006, Volvo relaunched the same program in 2009 to gain some market share and compete with BMW. The sales loss from 2006 to 2009 due to the previous cancellation is estimated to be 5000 new cars per year. Competitions and sponsorship Volvo entered the European Touring Car Championship with the Volvo 240 in the mid-80s. The cars also entered the Guia Race -- part of the Macau Grand Prix -- in 1985, 1986 and 1987, and won in both 1985 and 1986.

Volvo also entered the British Touring Car Championship in the 90s with Tom Walkinshaw Racing. This partnership was responsible for the controversial 850 Estate racing car, which was only rendered uncompetitive when the FIA allowed the use of aerodynamic aids in 1995. TWR then built and ran the 850 Saloon, with six wins in 1995 and five wins in 1996, and one win for the S40 in 1997 in the BTCC. In 1998, TWR Volvo won the British Touring Car Championship with Rickard Rydell driving the S40R. In 2008, Volvo entered the Swedish Touring Car Championship with a bioethanol E85 fuel powered C30. Robert Dahlgreen and Tommy Rustad drove, and finished 5th and 10th respectively in the championship. The Volvo trademark is now jointly owned (50/50) by Volvo Group and Volvo Car Corporation and, surprisingly, one of the main promotional activities for the brand is the sailing race, the Volvo Ocean Race , the world s leading round-the-world yacht race , (formerly known as the Whitbread Around the World Race).

There is also a Volvo Baltic Race and Volvo Pacific Race. Volvo has also had a long-standing commitment to the ISAF and is involved in the Volvo/ISAF World Youth Sailing Championships since 1997. In addition, Volvo also sponsors golf tournaments all over the world, including major championship events called the Volvo Masters and Volvo China Open. Volvo first sponsored the Volvo Ocean Race in 2001/2002. The current race has just finished with competitors taking to the sea at Allicante on the 29th of October, 2011, and the Groupama Sailing Team achieving overall victory in Galway, Ireland on the 5th of July 2012.

The Volvo Ocean Race is a test of sailing prowess and human endeavour built on the spirit of great seafarers -- fearless men who crossed the world's oceans aboard square-rigged clipper ships more than a century ago. Their challenge back then was not a race, but recording the fastest time between ports granted new levels of pride for themselves and great recognition for their vessel. That spirit and drive, which compelled those commercial sailors along the web of trade routes, deep into the bleak latitudes of the Southern Ocean and around the world's most dangerous capes, has directly inspired the Volvo Ocean Race -- a contest now seen as the pinnacle of achievement in the sport. The first edition of this sporting adventure came in the wake of two remarkable sailors of the 20th century, Sir Francis Chichester and Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who drew worldwide acclaim for amazing solo voyages around the planet. Inevitably, their success led to talk in international sailing circles of a race around the world for fully crewed yachts. It became a reality in 1973 with The Whitbread Round the World Race -- the longest, most demanding and perilous sporting contest the world had known. Dangerous, it was. In the very first race, three competing sailors were lost after being washed overboard during storms.

This inevitably led to the call for that inaugural contest to be the last, but the desire for unbridled adventure and great competition could not be stifled, and the race is now staged every four years. When Volvo began its sponsorship of the race in 2001/2002 , it was re-named the Volvo Ocean Race. During the nine months of the 2011/2012 Volvo Ocean Race, which started in Alicante, Spain in October 2011 and concludes in Galway, Ireland, in early July 2012, the teams sailed over 30,000 nautical miles of the world's most treacherous seas, via Cape Town; Abu Dhabi; Sanya, China; Aukland; Itajaí, Brazil; Lisbon; Miami; and Lorient, France. Each of the six teams has a sailing team of 11 professional crew, representing 15 nations; New Zealand, Australia, France, Spain, United States, Great Britain, Ireland, South Africa, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, Germany, Norway, Brazil, China and Belgium. T he race requires their utmost skills, physical endurance and competitive spirit as they sail day and night for more than 30 days at a time on some of the legs. They will each take on different jobs onboard the boat and on top of these sailing roles, there will be two sailors who have had medical training, as well as a sailmaker, an engineer and a media specialist.

During the race the crews will experience life at the extreme: no fresh food is taken onboard so they live off freeze-dried fare, they will experience temperature variations from -5 to +40 degrees Celsius and will only take one change of clothes. They will trust their lives to the boat and the skipper and experience hunger and sleep deprivation. The race is the ultimate mix of world class sporting competition and on the edge adventure, a unique blend of onshore glamour with offshore drama and endurance.

It is undeniably the worlds premier global race and one of the most demanding team sporting events in the world.

Volvo Trucks - North America maintains a strong commitment to its core value of environmental care, as well as responsible corporate citizenship by limiting its environmental impact on the community surrounding its Dublin, Virginia facility. In 2003 and 2004, Volvo continued that tradition of corporate responsibility by launching several ambitious initiatives that significantly reduced air and water emissions generated from the plant's manufacturing activities -- with the help of Essential Suite™ software from ESS. The Challenge Reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Reduce water use during cab leak testing process.

Minimize environmental footprint on local community. The Solution Essential Air™ Essential Waste™ Essential Chemical Inventory™ Essential Compliance Manager™ Essential Task Manager™ The Results Cut volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions 64%, from 24 to 8.6 pounds per truck. In 2003, Volvo set out to cut volatile organic compound (VOC) air emissions from 24 to 8.6 pounds per truck. Steps to achieve this objective included replacing waterborne paint, which was applied for up to 90% of the chassis production, with a zero VOC solvent-borne product. Additional steps cut VOC purge losses from 8 to less than 2 pounds per truck by 2005.

Overall, this project reduced reportable plantwide VOC emissions by 64 percent, or 15.4 pounds per truck. In 2004, Volvo established goals to curb the amount of water used for truck cab leak testing. The company invested in equipment to clean and recycle discharge from the leak testing process, which reduced water use from 2,082 to 1,253 gallons per truck. The following year, Volvo implemented additional measures that cut water use to 1,073 gallons per truck. This project cut total plant water use by 13 million gallons between 2003 and 2005, even though the plant's production activity increased during that period. As part of this project, Volvo also conducted a 2004 evaluation of its on-site waste water facility that sent permitted discharge to a local public waste water treatment site. A feasibility study showed that Volvo could reduce water use by recycling categorical waste water for reuse at the plant's cooling towers, air supply houses and paint booths.

This process reduces water use by 40,000 gallons per day, and Volvo managers estimate that this change will reduce water use by 10 million gallons per year. Both the air and water emission projects were supported by Volvo's integrated environmental information system, which was powered by Essential Air™, Essential Waste™, Essential Compliance Manager™, Essential Chemical Inventory™ and Essential Task Manager™. As a result of these initiatives, Volvo decreased its cost of inputs, resulting in improved processes, enhanced production efficiency and reached its objective of reducing its environmental impact on the local community.
