Installing Toilets Tips for a Water Efficient Bathroom Other Toilet Equipment Fascinating Toilets Beneath the Ocean In the Sky In Space Going Is Half The Battle! ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Introduction There's an age-old joke still doing the rounds about precisely who invented the toilet, or lavatory as the French prefer to call it. In the joke, the English claim the rights to having invented the toilet (one Thomas Crapper), but then, along came the French who cut a hole in the seat to make it usable! A number of people scratch their heads when told this joke, sort of like they can't see the wood for the trees! Jokes aside, toilets are a modern-day necessity, and life without them would be simply untenable, and not a little smelly either. With the global population now officially over the 7-billion count we have to find more improved ways of dealing with our effluent. Recognizing this is but one side of the equation, and that's because, at a rough guess less than half the population on Earth even has access to water-born waste systems. This means that they are polluting their environment with some very serious long term implications.

Our hidden treasure of underground water is rapidly becoming contaminated, and the consequences are that we will not be able to use this water in the future. In short, the world is grossly overpopulated as we stand today. Current projections suggest that by 2020, the global count will have reached 8.3-billion souls - what a stink that could cause for the planet as a whole. Apart from global warming issues and man-created industrial pollution, every man, woman and child that has walked this planet has directly contributed to overall pollution by leaving their waste behind.

Back in the early years of modern-man, the problem was not as prevalent as it is today, and that's because natural water systems were respected and even revered. Then, the population numbers started climbing and soon passed the safety limit, meaning there was never going to be enough clean water to go around. And it's not just water - crops and land remain BIG ISSUES as mankind sets about reproducing him/herself in even greater numbers. We are simply going to have to be more resourceful as a species, and we need to line up scientists and researchers to invent new systems that deal effectively with the problem of effluent - be it man's own waste or the accumulation of rubbish heaps globally. That said, please enjoy this article on the Toilet if you please!

Leak Detection and Repairs of Toilets When it comes to household water wastage, toilets are definitely the main culprits. Often, we aren't even aware that our toilets are leaking, and yet it is an easy problem to detect and fix. Often, it's down to worn washers or seals, and these are relatively cheap to replace. Just a small toilet leak can result in water bills of $50 or more a year, and the planet is not replenishing this scarce resource nearly quickly enough. A proper functioning toilet sees the water move from the tank to the bowl by way of pressing a button or pulling a lever. This releases a head of water to flush the bowl and remove the waste. In a leaking toilet, the water flows from tank to bowl constantly. You may not even here a "dripping" sound, but you will notice a higher water bill each month.

Toilet leak testing involves mixing a dye with the water in the tank. Around 20 minutes after dyeing the water, check the water in the toilet bowl. If it is still clear, then no water has leaked from the tank. If you should find even a hint of the dye, your toilet has a leak. With a serious leak, the toilet will actually flush constantly on its own accord, and this can be very confusing when it comes to detecting a leak. There are several possible causes of leaks in your toilet, but by far the most common is the valve that controls the release of water from the tank to the bowl.

In most toilets, this is a soft rubber flap. Even the water quality can erode these valves and chemicals added to the tank don't help either. These flaps may last from between 2 to 7 years. Replacing a toilet flapper valve is not expensive - they cost a maximum $10 - and it isn't that difficult a job for the average handy person.

Calling in a plumber can make this an expensive repair though. Plumbers charge for their travel time as well as for the time on the job. Don't be confused by the bewildering choice of flapper valves, it's really just a marketing gimmick. After isolating the water supply line to your toilet tank, simply remove the old valve and keep as a sample.

Then, when you get to the hardware or home improvement store, finding a replacement should be quick and easy. Your store attendant should be clued up and able to advise further. If you use an in-tank toilet cleaning product that contains chlorine or other strong chemical, you should consider spending a little extra for a flapper valve made of composite rubbers that are more resistant to the caustic effect of chemicals.

Installing a Retrofit Device In-Tank A startling statistic this one: In the U.S., approximately 40 percent of all domestic water used is flushed down the toilet. But that's not all, one person using an older 5.5 gallon flush toilet will use around 13,000 gallons of clean, fresh water a year just to dispose of 165 gallons of body waste. It's no surprise then that, a bewildering array of retrofit devices has been developed to improve the water consumption in our older toilets. Getting an old "loo" to use less water can make a significant difference to both consumption and water bills.

Put another way, since all water from the toilet goes directly into a water-born sewer or septic tank, saving water used by a toilet reduces both demand and wastewater flows. Hydraulic overload is the single most common cause of on-site wastewater treatment failure. Surface ponding and backup can often be eliminated simply by retrofitting with efficient toilet and showerhead mechanisms. Commonly, retrofitting older toilets simply means installing a displacement device. And these displacement devices are used primarily on non-conserving toilets in order to reduce the volume of water used each time the toilet is flushed. Typical displacement devices may include bricks, plastic bottles, or even plastic bags.

Of course, lighter items must be weight-loaded to ensure stability. If a brick is used, make sure to wrap it in a plastic wrap, or place it into a small garbage bag before placing it into the tank. Some bricks may deteriorate slightly if constantly in water and then cause damage to the flushing mechanisms through the breakdown of the composite material constituting a brick. Many types of displacement devices are simply placed into the tank, in a manner that they do not interfere with the function of the flushing mechanisms. They exercise control through the water volume, and there's a great saving be made each time the toilet is flushed under these conditions. These devices can reduce the amount of fresh water used by about 4.2 gallons per toilet, per day. Moreover, the use of these devices can reduce water consumption by around 13%, from the consumption which would have been used if the volume displacement devices were not in place.

Simply by reducing the amount of water available for each flush, a toilet displacement dam is a device which differs from the volume displacement device. The 'dam' consists of two sheets of plastic sheet wedged into the tank on either side of the flush mechanism. What happens is that the plastic holds back a small amount of water with each flush, thereby effecting a water saving. The technical specifications, claim that tank dams save around 6 gallons of water per toilet per day. This translates to a direct saving of around 18% on water consumption.

Another plus with tank dams is less movement in the cistern and therefor no interference with the flush mechanism. The early-close flapper is yet another retrofit to a toilet flushing system. Here, the device replaces the standard flapper valve and is designed to shut sooner, before all the water in the toilet tank can flow into the toilet bowl. Early-close flappers do offer an adjustment for the toilet owner to decide on the balance between saving water and having the toilet bowl properly cleansed.

Using a ULF Toilet In the U.S., approximately 40 percent of all domestic water consumed is flushed down the toilet. One person using an older 5.5 gallon flush toilet will use 13,000 gallons of fresh water per year to dispose of 165 gallons of body waste. For this reason, 1.6-gallon ultra-low flush (ULF) toilets are now required on new construction nationwide. Because the useful life of a toilet is measured in decades, older 3.5 gallon and 5.5 gallon models still constitute the majority of toilets in use. Replacing an older toilet with a 1.6 gallon model can significantly reduce water demand and stress on sewer systems. This is why many water suppliers offer inducements to replace older toilets. Toilet manufacturers now make a large variety of ULF toilets that use 0.7 to 1.6 gallons per flush.

These toilets rely on various mechanisms to accomplish their job using much less water. Since all water from the toilet goes directly into the sewer or septic tank, water saving toilets reduce both consumption and wastewater flows. Hydraulic overload is the single most common cause of on-site wastewater treatment failure. Surface ponding and backup can often be eliminated by retrofitting with efficient toilets and showerheads. Some versions of ULF toilets use early-close flapper valves to shut off flow between the toilet tank and bowl before the tank is fully drained. These toilets closely resemble older models in appearance and design, and often cost less than other options. One serious drawback, however, is that when the flapper valve inevitably wears out and begins to leak, the homeowner may not easily find the correct early-close replacement valve.

Often, homeowners aren't even aware that their toilets contain special flapper valves, and will inadvertently replace them with standard flapper valves. This causes a significant increase in water usage. Still other ULF toilets rely on some sort of proprietary flush mechanism. Many of these toilets work just fine when new, but all have rubber or plastic parts that eventually wear out and need replacing. Often, the homeowner will be unable to find the necessary parts! Many early ULF toilets were hastily designed and did not always work satisfactorily. Today, nearly all new ULF toilets are equal or superior to most conventional toilets in their ability to clean the bowl and move solids through sewers.

The key is for consumers to determine what parts will require replacing over time, and to buy spares in good time.

History of the Bidet Etching of ladies 'mounted' on bidets Circa 1790. Note the whip being carried by the male attendant! Probably barking, "Time's up ladies, please!" Other observation: is he holding his nose or smoking a cigar to cover the stench? Bidet means "pony" in French. Perhaps the comparison was drawn from the similarities between the way one mounts a bidet, in much the same way as straddling a pony.

It seems that the bidet was invented by French furniture makers in the late 17th or early 18th century, although the precise date, nor the inventor are recorded. Many in the know believe that its inventor was likely one Christopher des Rosiers, furniture maker for the French Royal Family . However, Marc-Antoine Jacoud is also rumored to have been the inventor.

The earliest recorded reference to the bidet was in 1710. The dawn of the nineteenth century saw the emergence of the flushing toilet, and a drop off in sales of the bidet, not to mention the faithful old chamber pot. This meant leaving the house to relieve oneself, whereas before a quick use of the "potty" was the preferred method, before returning this useful basin to where it belonged - under the bed! Fast forward to the 1960s, and the introduction of the electronic bidet. Re-enter the bidet in the modern home as a serious consideration among the woman folk!

A bidet is used primarily to wash and clean the genitalia, inner buttocks, and anus. These days, walking bare foot is popular, and so the bidet is a natural solution to rectifying this particular problem. The bidet's similar appearance to a toilet makes it usable for many other practical functions. When people are confused with bidets, they sometimes mistakingly confuse the facility for a urinal, toilet, or even a drinking fountain . Children believe that it is for washing sand from their feet, when they've have been to the beach.

Normally, people sit on the bidet facing the tap, and then use the water spray to wash the genitalia, and and anal area. Bidets are made in several different designs. Often, they may have one tap which supplies warm water into a porcelain basin. This basin can be plugged and filled if necessary, or the water can be allowed to drain away. Other bidets have a nozzle which propels an arc of water up into the air. This then washes the user's "under carriage".

A matching toilet and bidet will adorn any bathroom. Bidets are common bathroom fixtures in many southern European countries (especially Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece), some Latin American countries (such as Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay), some of Africa (Egypt and Morocco) and some parts of Asia (particularly in Japan, India and South Korea). Almost all houses in the Arabic world (including Lebanon, Syria, Jordan) and all Gulf countries such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates are equipped with bidets. Although France is the country where the word bidet originated, not every French home is equipped with one, especially the smaller or cheaper flats.

Although they do occasionally appear in the U.S., they are much less common there than in other countries. Integration of toilet and bidet A bidet may also be a nozzle attached to an existing toilet, or a part of the toilet itself. In this case, its use is restricted to cleaning the anus and genitals. Some bidets of this type have two nozzles, the shorter one, called the family nozzle, is used for washing the area around the anus, and the longer one (bidet nozzle) is designed for women to wash their vulvae. These bidets are often controlled electronically rather than with a traditional tap, and some have an element under the seat which heats up to dry the user after washing. These bidet toilets have been popular in countries like India since British colonial days, as the use of just dry toilet paper to clean the perianal area is considered dirty and unhygienic in these tropical regions. The nozzle is sometimes controlled with an external tap within the reach of the hand.

Traditionally, local style squatting toilets have been more common in India and are more convenient to most Indians, especially of the lower income groups. But with the rise of westernization, western style pots have started becoming more common, and the most convenient way to wash the perianal area with these pots is simply to attach a bidet nozzle. In 1980 the first "paperless toilet" was launched in Japan, a combination toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. Combination toilet-bidets with seat warmers, or " washlets ", are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households. They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities. These bidet-toilets, along with toilet seat/bidet units (to convert an existing toilet) are sold in many countries including the United States. Google headquarters in Mountain View, California has them installed. For details see toilets in Japan.

Bidet attachments are sometimes included on hospital toilets because of their utility in maintaining hygiene. Currently (2009) in the U.S., bidets are not widespread due in part to their cost ($400+), but are becoming increasingly popular, as witnessed by the increase in Toilet Seat Bidet market offerings and companies involved. In countries where the bidet is very common, prices are much lower. In Italy, for example, the price for a bidet seldom exceeds E200 (about $300 USD), and it is not uncommon to find bidets priced as low as 40 (about $60 USD), especially in do-it-yourself stores. An alternative in the USA would be buying a bidet attachment for regular American toilets. Many bidet retailers now offer toilet attachments that range from $79 to $650. In Middle Eastern countries, bidet attachments are much cheaper, being priced at around the equivalent of $10-20 USD, which is attributed to their popularity and availability.

Toilet seat bidet attachments are also becoming increasingly popular with the aging community. Many companies make bidet seat attachments that include remote controls to activate the water jets and air dryer. These conveniently placed remote controls may particularly benefit any individual with limited mobility.

Current designs Space Shuttle Waste Collection System Ever wondered how our astronauts go to the loo? Well, the toilet used on the Space Shuttle is called the Waste Collection System (WCS). In addition to air flow, it also uses rotating fans to distribute solid waste for in-flight storage. Solid waste is distributed in a cylindrical container which is then exposed to vacuum to dry the waste. Liquid waste is vented to space - hope there's nobody following!.

During STS-46, one of the fans malfunctioned, and crew member Claude Nicollier was required to perform in-flight maintenance (IFM). An earlier, complete failure, on the eight-day STS-3 test flight, forced its two-man crew ( Jack Lousma and Gordon Fullerton ) to use the much-hated "Apollo Bag" for waste elimination and disposal. Anyone for take aways? International Space Station The toilet on the International Space Station located in the Zvezda module uses a fan-driven suction system similar to the Space Shuttle WCS. Liquid waste is collected in 20 liter containers. Solid waste is collected in individual micro-perforated bags which are stored in an aluminum container.

Full containers are transferred to Progress for disposal. An additional Waste and Hygiene Compartment is scheduled be part of the Node 3 module to be launched in 2010. In 2007, NASA purchased a Russian-made toilet similar to the one already aboard ISS rather than develop one itself. Some light relief! On May 21, 2008, the 7-year-old toilet's gas liquid separator pump failed, although the solid waste portion remained functioning. The crew attempted replacing various parts, but was unable to repair the malfunctioning part. In the interim, they used a manual mode for urine collection. The crew had other options: use the toilet on the Soyuz transport module (which only had capacity for a few days of use) or to use urine collection bags as required.

A replacement pump was sent from Russia in a diplomatic pouch so that Space Shuttle Discovery could bring it to the station as part of mission STS-124 on June 2nd. Pity that international politics generally isn't as "down to earth"!

If you want a metric to show that we are on our way to civilization, try the proliferation of pay toilets in our public spaces. Soon, the days of dreading to walk into a restroom for fear of a mildew-mold-bacteria hybrid monster devouring you from the shoes up will be nothing but a nightmare to scare kids into behaving. No more urine puddles, no stray drops on the toilet seat.

No more bits of dinners past floating in the bowl. In a public restroom outside Vinzons Hall in the University of the Philippines, a toilet bowl has become filled to the brim that it looks like a ceramic flower pot without the flowers or any aesthetic value whatsoever. In an office restroom on Katipunan, someone once left soiled panties and a napkin in a puddle on the floor. It was like a serial killer leaving a calling card, but not as precise or thought out. There is no upper limit, it seems, to the depravity that men can aspire to, and, as is the case with many things, there is a need for someone to keep things in check. Or, at least, clean up afterwards. If you are lucky, someone to dispense lotion and cheap cologne too! Of course, for the Filipino with no pocket change and a bladder threatening to fail, pay toilets are the greatest form of capitalist oppression.

Just another way for The Man to tell us where, when, and how to do our business. And this is valid, too. Two sides of the same 5-Peso coin, one might say. Finishing on a comical note - just like we started, I once worked for a large corporate where ladies and gents toilets were practically located on each floor of the multrise building. However, I was intrigued when I visited the entirely female complement of data capture clerks on a floor they had to themselves. When I asked what they did with the urinals in the men's toilet, I was tickled by their response -"why, it's the perfect place to grow and water pot plants". Also, there was no contention here with "who left the toilet seat up?" either!
